HOVER	10744	To the creepy forest	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	83
HOVER	10745	Thank goodness, a lamp!	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	93
HOVER	10746	A forgotten lamp	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	93
GUYBRUSH	31607	It's an old oil lamp, with a little lamp fuel inside.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	95
HOVER	10747	Gimme!	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	98
HOVER	10748	Take the lamp	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	98
HOVER	10749	This cooking pot seems like an ill omen	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	106
GUYBRUSH	31608	I'm not sure I want to know what happened here.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	108
GUYBRUSH	31609	I'll be fine as long as I don't lose my wits, and keep my head.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	108
HOVER	10750	A grisly skeleton	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	114
GUYBRUSH	31610	Looks like he had the wrong person watching his back.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	116
GUYBRUSH	31611	What really bothers me is, why do these pirates look familiar?	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	116
HOVER	10751	Another ill fated soul	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	122
GUYBRUSH	31612	Looks like another greedy pirate who met a sordid fate.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	124
GUYBRUSH	31613	This place gives me the creeps.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	124
HOVER	12174	Extra large killer ant	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	130
GUYBRUSH	31614	It's looking at me funny, and I don't trust it.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	132
HOVER	10753	Eww!	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	140
GUYBRUSH	31615	Ugh, a creepy bug.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	142
GUYBRUSH	31616	Stay on that lump and don't bother me.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	142
HOVER	10754	It's some abandoned firewood	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	163
GUYBRUSH	31617	It looks really old and dry.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	165
HOVER	10755	Take the firewood	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	168
GUYBRUSH	31618	I think I'll fill up my coat pockets with this bulky firewood. It seems like it might come in handy somewhere, and I'm sure no one will miss it.	AbandonedPirateCamp.dinky	171
ELAINE	32761	Slowpoke.	AbandonedShip.dinky	133
GUYBRUSH	32762	You had a head start!	AbandonedShip.dinky	135
ELAINE	38799	Any time you're ready, Guybrush.	AbandonedShip.dinky	147
HOVER	11647	Into the jungle	AbandonedShip.dinky	277
HOVER	11653	I can hardly believe it	AbandonedShip.dinky	334
HOVER	11654	Read the plaque	AbandonedShip.dinky	334
GUYBRUSH	32763	It says, “The▫︎Sea▫︎Monkey”!	AbandonedShip.dinky	338
GUYBRUSH	32764	Hey, this is my old ship from Monkey Island 1!	AbandonedShip.dinky	340
GUYBRUSH	32765	Wow!	AbandonedShip.dinky	341
GUYBRUSH	32766	The▫︎Sea▫︎Monkey brought me adventure and fame! I feel like this is a good omen.	AbandonedShip.dinky	342
GUYBRUSH	32767	Either that or this forgotten wreck of a ship discarded on the beach is highly symbolic.	AbandonedShip.dinky	343
GUYBRUSH	32768	“The▫︎Sea▫︎Monkey.” Wow!	AbandonedShip.dinky	348
GUYBRUSH	32769	It's a spooky skull.	AbandonedShip.dinky	359
GUYBRUSH	32770	Murray? Is that you? Sorry about flattening you.	AbandonedShip.dinky	362
GUYBRUSH	32771	Oh. It's just a spooky skull.	AbandonedShip.dinky	366
GUYBRUSH	32772	I'll keep this for Halloween.	AbandonedShip.dinky	367
HOVER	11655	Pick up the skull	AbandonedShip.dinky	371
HOVER	11656	Conk the skull	AbandonedShip.dinky	377
HOVER	11657	Contemplate the task at hand	AbandonedShip.dinky	389
HOVER	11658	Remember the Sea Monkey	AbandonedShip.dinky	389
HOVER	11659	Inspect the wreckage	AbandonedShip.dinky	389
GUYBRUSH	32773	People repair ships all the time. How hard could it be?	AbandonedShip.dinky	393
GUYBRUSH	32774	I have no idea how to fix this.	AbandonedShip.dinky	395
GUYBRUSH	32775	I'd love to get the old girl running again. It'd be a great summer project.	AbandonedShip.dinky	399
GUYBRUSH	32776	This really puts the “wreck” in “shipwreck.”	AbandonedShip.dinky	401
GUYBRUSH	32777	My sympathies to the unlucky captain.	AbandonedShip.dinky	401
HOVER	11660	Fierce jagged rock	AbandonedShip.dinky	409
GUYBRUSH	32778	The age old battle of rock versus hull only ever ends one way.	AbandonedShip.dinky	411
HOVER	11661	Shoreline rocks	AbandonedShip.dinky	421
GUYBRUSH	32779	The rocks around here are treacherous. I'll have to be careful not to stub my toe.	AbandonedShip.dinky	423

BOYBRUSH	30015	Ha ha! Yeah!	Beginning.dinky	84
BOYBRUSH	30016	Sorry we ran off!	Beginning.dinky	94

CHUCKIE	30024	Let's pretend I have powers that make lightning come out of my eyes!	Beginning.dinky	132
SFX	19000	Squawk!	Beginning.dinky	139
PARKFEMALE	38556	It's so lifelike.	Beginning.dinky	149
SFX	19001	Squawk!	Beginning.dinky	152
PARKMALE	38555	I wonder if it's real?	Beginning.dinky	156

BOYBRUSH	30031	Scurvydogs! I've never had one of those!	Beginning.dinky	195
CHUCKIE	30032	No way! You have to try one!	Beginning.dinky	222
CHUCKIE	30033	It's the best thing you'll ever eat in your life, no fooling!	Beginning.dinky	224
BOYBRUSH	30034	Wow!	Beginning.dinky	226
MURRAY	38805	Are you actually leaving me here after I got you the map?!	BelowCliff.dinky	14
MURRAY	38806	You'll pay for this, you selfish pink meatbag!	BelowCliff.dinky	17
HOVER	11800	What's the title again?	BelowCliff.dinky	89
HOVER	11801	Elaine is so thoughtful	BelowCliff.dinky	89
HOVER	11802	Grab the repair manual	BelowCliff.dinky	94
HOVER	11803	Talk to Murray	BelowCliff.dinky	110
GUYBRUSH	32911	I feel like we're entering a new phase in our relationship.	BelowCliff.dinky	112
MURRAY	32912	I'm trying to contain my joy.	BelowCliff.dinky	114
HOVER	12222	Conk Murray	BelowCliff.dinky	117
HOVER	11804	Pick up Murray	BelowCliff.dinky	131
GUYBRUSH	32913	Come on, Murray! We've got our work cut out for us!	BelowCliff.dinky	135
MURRAY	32914	I don't relish the idea of being with you, but I guess it beats spending the next hundred years on this stump.	BelowCliff.dinky	137
MURRAY	32915	Maybe.	BelowCliff.dinky	139
MURRAY	32916	Wait, not the pocket!	BelowCliff.dinky	147
HOVER	11805	Onward to certain success	BelowCliff.dinky	157
HOVER	11806	Race Elaine to the ship	BelowCliff.dinky	157
HOVER	11808	Onward to certain success	BelowCliff.dinky	175
HOVER	11809	I think the ship's actually this way!	BelowCliff.dinky	175
LECHUCK	35047	(to self)It came from over here somewhere...	BelowCliff.yack	30
LECHUCK	35048	What the? Threepwood!	BelowCliff.yack	42
LECHUCK	35049	Alive!	BelowCliff.yack	45
LECHUCK	35050	...sort of.	BelowCliff.yack	46
GUYBRUSH	35051	-urk-	BelowCliff.yack	48
GUYBRUSH	35052	-gurgle-	BelowCliff.yack	49
GUYBRUSH	35053	-gasp-	BelowCliff.yack	50
LECHUCK	35054	So, you survived walking the plank, only to stumble off a cliff!	BelowCliff.yack	57
LECHUCK	35055	I always knew you were a buffoon, but this really takes the prize.	BelowCliff.yack	58
LECHUCK	35056	Speaking of taking the prize, as you lie here, slowly dying, feel free to torment yourself with the knowledge that I will shortly have The Secret...	BelowCliff.yack	60
LECHUCK	35057	...and then the fair Elaine as well!	BelowCliff.yack	61
LECHUCK	35058	Hahahahaha!	BelowCliff.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	35059	Nnkk!	BelowCliff.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	35060	Grrk!	BelowCliff.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	35061	Llnnn!	BelowCliff.yack	66
LECHUCK	35062	I didn't quite catch that, but no matter. Your last words will be forgotten along with you.	BelowCliff.yack	69
LECHUCK	35063	And the dubious tales of your paltry exploits will likewise wither and be gone, without so much as a stone to mark where they were.	BelowCliff.yack	70
LECHUCK	35064	You will be nothing.	BelowCliff.yack	71
LECHUCK	35065	Soon not even the stench of your passing will remain, as the world moves implacably onward.	BelowCliff.yack	72
IRONROSE	35066	Captain LeChuck!	BelowCliff.yack	80
IRONROSE	35067	It's Captain Madison, sir. She and the others have just set sail! They're leaving the island!	BelowCliff.yack	85
LECHUCK	35068	Leaving!?	BelowCliff.yack	86		UPDATE
LECHUCK	35069	They must know where The Secret is!	BelowCliff.yack	87
LECHUCK	35070	If we hurry, we can catch them at sea and “persuade” them to share!	BelowCliff.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	35071	Oof. This hurts.	BelowCliff.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	35072	I think it hurts more than that time with the cannon and the tent pole.	BelowCliff.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	35073	I think my pancreas is broken.	BelowCliff.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	35074	Possibly also my spleen.	BelowCliff.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	35075	And my gall bladder, whatever that is.	BelowCliff.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	35076	I've got to follow them.	BelowCliff.yack	105
GUYBRUSH	35077	Yep.	BelowCliff.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	35078	Just as soon as I can get my knees bending in the right direction again.	BelowCliff.yack	107
ELAINE	35079	Hello, is someone here?	BelowCliff.yack	117
ELAINE	35080	Guybrush!	BelowCliff.yack	123
ELAINE	35081	Oh no! Are you okay?	BelowCliff.yack	130
GUYBRUSH	35082	It only hurts when I breathe.	BelowCliff.yack	133
ELAINE	35083	Still, best to keep that up, I think.	BelowCliff.yack	134
GUYBRUSH	35084	If I have to.	BelowCliff.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	35085	I think my pancreas is broken.	BelowCliff.yack	136
ELAINE	35086	Do you even know where your pancreas is?	BelowCliff.yack	137
GUYBRUSH	35087	Judging by the pain, I'd say everywhere.	BelowCliff.yack	138
GUYBRUSH	35088	Depends on your definition of “okay.”	BelowCliff.yack	139
ELAINE	35089	Let's start with “likely to survive the next two minutes.”	BelowCliff.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	35090	I suppose I can manage that if I have to.	BelowCliff.yack	141
ELAINE	35091	Oh I'm afraid I insist.	BelowCliff.yack	142		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	35092	What are you doing here? Did you come to rescue me?	BelowCliff.yack	144
ELAINE	35093	Looks like it, though I didn't know it 'til just now.	BelowCliff.yack	145		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	35094	How did you even get to Monkey Island? I guess you made the potion?	BelowCliff.yack	147
ELAINE	35095	You used a potion to get here? That's so cute.	BelowCliff.yack	148
ELAINE	35096	But let's not get sidetracked. You've fallen off a cliff.	BelowCliff.yack	149
GUYBRUSH	35097	This whole voyage has been a disaster.	BelowCliff.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	35098	Nothing but humiliation, physical danger, and humiliating physical danger.	BelowCliff.yack	153
GUYBRUSH	35099	I keep losing swordfights.	BelowCliff.yack	154
GUYBRUSH	35100	I got thrown off a ship and thrown off a cliff on the same day.	BelowCliff.yack	155
GUYBRUSH	35101	I got caught in a snare trap meant for LeChuck. My own fault.	BelowCliff.yack	156
GUYBRUSH	35102	I had a map, there was an X. And a shovel.	BelowCliff.yack	157
ELAINE	35103	You didn't find that suspicious?	BelowCliff.yack	158
GUYBRUSH	35104	You had to be there.	BelowCliff.yack	159
GUYBRUSH	35105	The last few months have been a waste.	BelowCliff.yack	160
GUYBRUSH	35106	I shouldn't have come to Monkey Island.	BelowCliff.yack	161
GUYBRUSH	35107	I shouldn't have even come to Mêlée Island.	BelowCliff.yack	162
GUYBRUSH	35108	I should have given up after stupid Madison and her friends laughed at me.	BelowCliff.yack	163
GUYBRUSH	35109	Or when my only option was to sail with LeChuck.	BelowCliff.yack	164
GUYBRUSH	35110	Or when his crew all told me why they thought going after The Secret was a bad idea.	BelowCliff.yack	165
GUYBRUSH	35111	Why can't I see the signs? What did I think I was doing?	BelowCliff.yack	166
ELAINE	35112	You were just being you.	BelowCliff.yack	167
GUYBRUSH	35113	I can't compete with LeChuck OR Madison, let alone both.	BelowCliff.yack	168
GUYBRUSH	35114	They've got crews.	BelowCliff.yack	169
GUYBRUSH	35115	They've got ships.	BelowCliff.yack	170
GUYBRUSH	35116	They've got supernatural magic powers.	BelowCliff.yack	171
GUYBRUSH	35117	I've got some crackers, and two monocles.	BelowCliff.yack	172
ELAINE	35118	And your charming personality.	BelowCliff.yack	173
GUYBRUSH	35119	I might as well just lie here and starve to death.	BelowCliff.yack	175
ELAINE	35120	I've got a better idea.	BelowCliff.yack	176
ELAINE	35121	Come back with me to Scurvy Island. I'll take a break from the scurvy project to nurse you back to health.	BelowCliff.yack	177
GUYBRUSH	35122	If you want.	BelowCliff.yack	180
ELAINE	35123	Don't act too excited, now.	BelowCliff.yack	181
GUYBRUSH	35124	What difference does it make?	BelowCliff.yack	183
ELAINE	35125	It makes a difference to me, if nothing else. Come on, let's go.	BelowCliff.yack	184
GUYBRUSH	35126	Why not, I'll never get The Secret now that the map is gone.	BelowCliff.yack	186
MURRAY	35127	(holding something in his teeth - Did somebody say map?)Id shunguddy shay gnack?	BelowCliff.yack	198
ELAINE	35128	Hello?	BelowCliff.yack	210
GUYBRUSH	35129	Murray! Is that the map to The Secret?!	BelowCliff.yack	256
MURRAY	35130	That melonhead put me in his pocket with it. I grabbed it for leverage.	BelowCliff.yack	257
GUYBRUSH	39007	Holy cow!	BelowCliff.yack	266
GUYBRUSH	35131	The Secret is at the Voodoo Shop on Mêlée Island!	BelowCliff.yack	268
GUYBRUSH	35132	Change of plan, Elaine, we're going back to Mêlée!	BelowCliff.yack	279
ELAINE	35133	We are? What about all the things you just said?	BelowCliff.yack	280
GUYBRUSH	35134	I must have hit my head.	BelowCliff.yack	282
GUYBRUSH	35135	I didn't have the map then.	BelowCliff.yack	283
GUYBRUSH	35136	We'd better hurry if we're going to get there first.	BelowCliff.yack	284
GUYBRUSH	35137	Where's your ship?	BelowCliff.yack	287
ELAINE	35138	It's actually your ship.	BelowCliff.yack	288
ELAINE	35139	Your old ship, I mean. The Sea Monkey is wrecked on a beach just east of here.	BelowCliff.yack	289
GUYBRUSH	35140	I know, I saw it!	BelowCliff.yack	291
GUYBRUSH	35141	That wreck is the Sea Monkey?	BelowCliff.yack	292
GUYBRUSH	35142	It is?	BelowCliff.yack	293
ELAINE	35143	I got dropped off here so I could fix it up as a surprise for your birthday.	BelowCliff.yack	295
GUYBRUSH	35144	What a great present! You always amaze me. I had no idea you knew ship repair!	BelowCliff.yack	296
ELAINE	35145	I don't know any more than you do. But I bought a manual.	BelowCliff.yack	297
ELAINE	35146	Why don't we fix it together?	BelowCliff.yack	311
GUYBRUSH	35147	Fantastic! Thank you!	BelowCliff.yack	313
GUYBRUSH	35148	You can do the goopy parts.	BelowCliff.yack	314
GUYBRUSH	35149	Dibs on the good hammer.	BelowCliff.yack	315
ELAINE	35150	Race you to the ship!	BelowCliff.yack	318
STAN	50000	I've got to go now, got a lot of irons in a lot fires, you know how it is. But I'll be back to steal every scene I'm in in Return to Monkey Island! I'll see you there! Okay, roll the logo!	Boot.dinky	286		DELETE

CARLA	36508	(menace)Guybrush Threepwood!	Carla.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	36509	(menace)Hello, Swordmaster.	Carla.yack	79
CARLA	36510	Prepare to taste my blade, you washed-up hack!	Carla.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	36511	Anything but your cooking!	Carla.yack	109
CARLA	36512	Ha! Low-hanging fruit, but it works.	Carla.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	36513	When was the last time YOU had a bath?	Carla.yack	111
CARLA	36514	Ha! That was marginally clever.	Carla.yack	112
GUYBRUSH	36515	Let me show you what a “hack” looks like.	Carla.yack	113
CARLA	36516	Haha! Pretty good, Guybrush. Right on point.	Carla.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	36517	It's nice to see you again.	Carla.yack	119
CARLA	36518	You too.	Carla.yack	120
GUYBRUSH	36519	You should never have given up being Swordmaster.	Carla.yack	130
CARLA	36520	Who says I did?	Carla.yack	131
GUYBRUSH	36521	Whoops, sorry, I just assumed. Governor seems like a full-time job.	Carla.yack	132
CARLA	36522	It is, but there's room for overlap if you're creative about it.	Carla.yack	133
GUYBRUSH	36523	How's the governorship treating you?	Carla.yack	134
CARLA	36524	It's not as straightforward as I'd hoped.	Carla.yack	135
CARLA	36525	For some reason you can't just tell everyone what to do and assume they'll do it.	Carla.yack	136
CARLA	36526	That's new territory for me.	Carla.yack	137
GUYBRUSH	36527	Not for me! Maybe I should be governor.	Carla.yack	138
GUYBRUSH	36528	I hope you're not still sore about that thing with the ship that one time.	Carla.yack	139
CARLA	36529	Ancient history.	Carla.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	36530	Oh good!	Carla.yack	141
CARLA	36531	I can think of plenty of more recent things to hold against you.	Carla.yack	142
GUYBRUSH	36532	Oh.	Carla.yack	143
GUYBRUSH	36533	You've come far since I got you your first cushy government job.	Carla.yack	144
CARLA	36534	I hope you're not about to try to take credit for me being governor.	Carla.yack	145
CARLA	36535	Because that would be both absurd and obnoxious, and I might have to skewer you for it.	Carla.yack	146
GUYBRUSH	36536	-ahem- No! No. Furthest thing from my mind.	Carla.yack	147
CARLA	36537	I heard from your wife.	Carla.yack	157
CARLA	36538	I saw your wife.	Carla.yack	158
CARLA	36539	She came by to talk about scurvy legislation.	Carla.yack	159
CARLA	36540	She's coming by to talk about scurvy legislation.	Carla.yack	160
CARLA	36541	I assume you're involved with that somehow?	Carla.yack	161
GUYBRUSH	36542	Elaine can handle it, she doesn't need me.	Carla.yack	170
CARLA	36543	I don't doubt that, but it isn't about what she does or doesn't need.	Carla.yack	171
GUYBRUSH	36544	I've got my own project cooking.	Carla.yack	172
CARLA	36545	Of course you do.	Carla.yack	173
GUYBRUSH	36546	I'm not automatically involved with everything Elaine does just because we're married.	Carla.yack	174
CARLA	36547	I can see that.	Carla.yack	175
GUYBRUSH	36548	Elaine said that program is being hampered by Captain Madison.	Carla.yack	176
CARLA	36549	Not the legislative part, just the public funding.	Carla.yack	177
CARLA	36550	If it isn't about the scurvy project, why are you here?	Carla.yack	185
GUYBRUSH	36551	How about that earthquake!	Carla.yack	200
GUYBRUSH	36552	I was a little worried about the mansion, being built on a precarious cliff and all.	Carla.yack	201
CARLA	36553	The mansion's fine. And so am I, thanks for asking.	Carla.yack	202
GUYBRUSH	36554	Have you seen the line of people outside?	Carla.yack	204
CARLA	36555	Those are citizens who were affected by the quake.	Carla.yack	207
CARLA	36556	Elaine was here to help me set up a program.	Carla.yack	208
CARLA	36557	But there isn't any money in the coffers to support the relief effort.	Carla.yack	209
CARLA	39518	I'm basically handing out IOUs.	Carla.yack	210
GUYBRUSH	36559	Can I get in on some of that sweet, sweet disaster relief?	Carla.yack	212
GUYBRUSH	36560	Can I get any more disaster relief IOUs?	Carla.yack	213
GUYBRUSH	36561	Can I revise my disaster relief project?	Carla.yack	214
CARLA	36562	Fine. What is it this time?	Carla.yack	215
GUYBRUSH	36563	I've come for a recipe.	Carla.yack	217
GUYBRUSH	36564	A dish you served at a recent function.	Carla.yack	218
GUYBRUSH	36565	It's been described as “hot” and as having ingredients in it. Ring any bells?	Carla.yack	219
GUYBRUSH	36566	It's been described as having ingredients in it. Ring any bells?	Carla.yack	220
CARLA	36567	Barbie LeFlay catered that event. I own her cookbook, but I don't know any of the recipes.	Carla.yack	221
CARLA	36568	I do host plenty of functions, but I'm afraid I don't have any idea what you're talking about.	Carla.yack	222
GUYBRUSH	36569	Do you know where I can find Barbie LeFlay?	Carla.yack	224
CARLA	36570	Middle of the Atlantic Ocean? She's halfway back to France by now.	Carla.yack	225
GUYBRUSH	36571	Remind me what you said about the recipe I asked for?	Carla.yack	227
CARLA	36572	I said I didn't make the food, but I've got the cookbook.	Carla.yack	228
GUYBRUSH	39282	Can we try the frog again?	Carla.yack	230
GUYBRUSH	36573	I'm looking for The Secret of Monkey Island.	Carla.yack	231
CARLA	36574	Good for you. I don't have it.	Carla.yack	232
GUYBRUSH	36575	I'll be needing a crew. You interested?	Carla.yack	235
CARLA	36576	Ha! I'd rather swallow a live badger than crew with you again. No offense intended.	Carla.yack	236
GUYBRUSH	36577	So, unlikely but still possible?	Carla.yack	237
CARLA	36578	No.	Carla.yack	238
CARLA	39283	You want a crew, go down to the docks and hire one.	Carla.yack	239
GUYBRUSH	36579	Is there a government program that funds expeditions to find Secrets of Monkey Island?	Carla.yack	241
CARLA	36580	(sarcasm)Oh, gosh, you're too late for that one.	Carla.yack	242
CARLA	36581	(sarcasm)We cancelled it last year and diverted the funds to build a habitat for the rare Caribbean whining leech.	Carla.yack	243
GUYBRUSH	36582	Darn!	Carla.yack	244
CARLA	39284	There's a ship at the docks that's headed for Monkey Island.	Carla.yack	245
GUYBRUSH	39285	I think you're talking about LeChuck's ship.	Carla.yack	246
CARLA	39286	Do you want to go to Monkey Island or don't you?	Carla.yack	247
GUYBRUSH	36583	We have unfinished business from the old days.	Carla.yack	249
CARLA	36584	You're darn right we do. I'm still waiting for my book back.	Carla.yack	251
GUYBRUSH	36585	Oh! That's... not even something I remember, but okay.	Carla.yack	252
GUYBRUSH	36586	You first, what are YOU doing here?	Carla.yack	254
CARLA	36587	Don't be weird.	Carla.yack	255
CARLA	36588	I know Elaine used to live here, but it's my house now that I'm governor.	Carla.yack	256
GUYBRUSH	36589	Elaine says Captain Madison is hurting her scurvy project.	Carla.yack	258
CARLA	36590	Not the legislative part, just the public funding.	Carla.yack	259
GUYBRUSH	36591	The new downtown graffiti art is kind of cool.	Carla.yack	261
CARLA	36592	No, it isn't! I just don't have the funds to do any kind of cleanup.	Carla.yack	262
GUYBRUSH	36593	The mansion hasn't changed much.	Carla.yack	264
GUYBRUSH	36594	Elaine's style is still everywhere. Even the books are hers.	Carla.yack	265
CARLA	36595	They're my books now. As you well know.	Carla.yack	266
GUYBRUSH	36596	I should let you get back to governing.	Carla.yack	268
CARLA	36597	Yes, you should.	Carla.yack	269
GUYBRUSH	36598	I don't really have anything to say, I just like doing this.	Carla.yack	273
CARLA	36599	Practice is nice, but I'm busy these days. Governor stuff.	Carla.yack	274
CARLA	36600	The town was in a bind a while back, and that so-and-so Captain Madison saw an opportunity.	Carla.yack	280
CARLA	36601	She lent us the cash we needed, but now we're up a creek paying the interest.	Carla.yack	281
CARLA	36602	Things like social programs, waste management, and town maintenance are all on the back burner.	Carla.yack	282
GUYBRUSH	36603	I like that woman less every minute.	Carla.yack	283
CARLA	36604	You and me both.	Carla.yack	284
GUYBRUSH	36605	Can I borrow a book?	Carla.yack	290
CARLA	36606	You've got a lot of nerve asking that.	Carla.yack	298
CARLA	36607	You never brought back the last book you borrowed!	Carla.yack	299
CARLA	36608	I had to buy another copy!	Carla.yack	300
CARLA	36609	You never even apologized!	Carla.yack	301
GUYBRUSH	36610	I totally forgot.	Carla.yack	303
CARLA	36611	Of course you did. You think like a cow.	Carla.yack	304
GUYBRUSH	36612	I'll pay for it.	Carla.yack	306
CARLA	36613	I don't need your money.	Carla.yack	307
GUYBRUSH	36614	I'm sorry.	Carla.yack	309
CARLA	36615	Yeah...	Carla.yack	310
CARLA	36616	I'm hearing the words, but somehow they aren't helping.	Carla.yack	311
CARLA	36617	I need more than that.	Carla.yack	312
GUYBRUSH	39287	Can we try the frog again?	Carla.yack	314
GUYBRUSH	36618	Can I borrow this book?	Carla.yack	319
CARLA	36619	One book at a time. I only trust you so far.	Carla.yack	321
GUYBRUSH	36620	Can I borrow this book?	Carla.yack	326
CARLA	36621	Oh, all right. I was upset after you lost the last one, but you seem genuinely sorry, so, I guess I'll give you another chance.	Carla.yack	328
CARLA	36622	Fine, fine.	Carla.yack	329
GUYBRUSH	36623	Thanks! I won't let you down, I'll definitely return this!	Carla.yack	330
GUYBRUSH	36624	Can I borrow this cookbook?	Carla.yack	336
CARLA	36625	You cook like a cow!	Carla.yack	345
GUYBRUSH	36626	That's why I need the cookbook!	Carla.yack	346
CARLA	36627	Oh, all right. I was upset after you lost the last one, but you seem genuinely sorry, so, I guess I'll give you another chance.	Carla.yack	347
CARLA	36628	Fine, fine.	Carla.yack	348
GUYBRUSH	36629	Thanks! I won't let you down, I'll definitely return this!	Carla.yack	349
GUYBRUSH	36630	Would you like this book for your collection?	Carla.yack	356
CARLA	36631	Have you lost your mind?	Carla.yack	365
GUYBRUSH	36632	Why? Did you find one?	Carla.yack	366		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	36633	Why? You looking to trade up?	Carla.yack	367		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	36634	Possibly?	Carla.yack	368
CARLA	36635	I can see the bookplate from here. Don't try to hand me one of LeChuck's books. I don't need the trouble.	Carla.yack	370
CARLA	36636	I already told you there's no money! I'm handing out IOUs.	Carla.yack	395
GUYBRUSH	36637	I'll take what I can get.	Carla.yack	396
CARLA	36638	Fine, it's not real money anyway.	Carla.yack	397
CARLA	36639	I have to list a purpose, so... what's it for?	Carla.yack	398
CARLA	36640	It's one to a customer!	Carla.yack	401
CARLA	36641	If you want, I can revise the IOU I gave you to apply to a different project, but that's as far as I can go.	Carla.yack	402
GUYBRUSH	36642	Yes please.	Carla.yack	403
CARLA	36643	Ok, what do you want to do?	Carla.yack	404
GUYBRUSH	36644	Never mind.	Carla.yack	405
GUYBRUSH	36645	My ship suffered some damage, it needs a keel overhaul.	Carla.yack	410
CARLA	36646	Sounds dubious, but I've heard worse.	Carla.yack	412
GUYBRUSH	36647	The jail needs to be reinforced.	Carla.yack	413
CARLA	36648	Well that's certainly true.	Carla.yack	415
GUYBRUSH	36649	I want to rebuild local businesses.	Carla.yack	416
CARLA	36650	I'm sure you'll have public support on that one.	Carla.yack	418
GUYBRUSH	36651	The Mêlée amusement park is in terrible shape.	Carla.yack	419
CARLA	36652	Mêlée doesn't have an amusement park.	Carla.yack	421
GUYBRUSH	36653	I rest my case.	Carla.yack	422
GUYBRUSH	36654	We need to get the shipyard fixed up.	Carla.yack	423
CARLA	36655	If you say so.	Carla.yack	425
GUYBRUSH	36656	There's a huge, hazardous crack on Low Street.	Carla.yack	426
CARLA	36657	You say hazard, I say public parkour course. But I guess you're right.	Carla.yack	428
CARLA	36658	This is just a promise from the town to back your relief project at a later date. Don't get too excited.	Carla.yack	446
CARLA	36659	Here you go.	Carla.yack	466
GUYBRUSH	36660	Can I get this applied to a different project?	Carla.yack	486
CARLA	36661	Fine, fine. What do you want?	Carla.yack	487

BOYBRUSH	35709	This place is gross.	Chuckie.yack	22
CHUCKIE	35710	While we're in here, let's look for coins! They fall out of people's pockets sometimes.	Chuckie.yack	23
BOYBRUSH	35711	Maybe we should get out of here.	Chuckie.yack	27
CHUCKIE	35712	I dare you to pick up that slug.	Chuckie.yack	28
BOYBRUSH	35713	What should we do next?	Chuckie.yack	32
CHUCKIE	35714	We've got to get the Scurvydogs! I can't believe you've never had one.	Chuckie.yack	33		UPDATE
BOYBRUSH	35715	I'm not sure how we can get Scurvydogs without any pieces of eight.	Chuckie.yack	37
CHUCKIE	35716	We might have all we need. I don't think that guy can see very well.	Chuckie.yack	38
VENDOR	39149	I can hear just fine, though. You'd better not be up to something!	Chuckie.yack	39
BOYBRUSH	35717	Where should we look?	Chuckie.yack	43
CHUCKIE	35718	All over. Do you see any coins?	Chuckie.yack	44
BOYBRUSH	35719	I don't see any coins. Not real ones, anyway.	Chuckie.yack	48
CHUCKIE	35720	I dare you to pick up that slug.	Chuckie.yack	49
BOYBRUSH	35721	How are we going to get into the outhouse?	Chuckie.yack	53
CHUCKIE	35722	Usually the shops have keys.	Chuckie.yack	54
BOYBRUSH	35723	How are we going to get into the outhouse?	Chuckie.yack	58
CHUCKIE	35724	The Scurvydog guy has a key.	Chuckie.yack	59
BOYBRUSH	35725	How are we going to get into the outhouse?	Chuckie.yack	63
CHUCKIE	35726	There's a key right there on the wall.	Chuckie.yack	64
BOYBRUSH	35727	What should we do next?	Chuckie.yack	67
CHUCKIE	35728	Let's look for change in the outhouse, maybe we can find enough to get Scurvydogs.	Chuckie.yack	68
CHUCKIE	35744	Let's be frank, you can never hope to beat me!	Chuckie.yack	91
BOYBRUSH	35745	No way, you'll never ketchup to my level!	Chuckie.yack	93
BOYBRUSH	35746	I relish the opportunity, you scurvy dog!	Chuckie.yack	94
BOYBRUSH	35747	I mustard give it a try just the same!	Chuckie.yack	95
CHUCKIE	35748	Your sword is as sharp as a banana!	Chuckie.yack	101
BOYBRUSH	35749	I'll still pear you down to size!	Chuckie.yack	103
BOYBRUSH	35750	And your brain is almost as sharp as that!	Chuckie.yack	104
BOYBRUSH	35751	What a corn-y line!	Chuckie.yack	105
CHUCKIE	35752	You're about as scary as a bowl of oatmeal!	Chuckie.yack	111
BOYBRUSH	35753	I'll be sure to break you fast!	Chuckie.yack	113
BOYBRUSH	35754	This will be a grueling fight for you!	Chuckie.yack	114
BOYBRUSH	35755	Oatmeal is actually kind of scary though.	Chuckie.yack	115
CHUCKIE	35756	You fight like a doofus!	Chuckie.yack	121
BOYBRUSH	35757	Yeah! Like a doofus who's an amazing fighter, you mean!	Chuckie.yack	123		UPDATE
BOYBRUSH	35758	How appropriate, you fight like a goober!	Chuckie.yack	124
BOYBRUSH	35759	So's your old man!	Chuckie.yack	125
CHUCKIE	35760	I win!	Chuckie.yack	137
BOYBRUSH	35761	I win!	Chuckie.yack	138
CHUCKIE	35762	Nuh uh!	Chuckie.yack	139
CHUCKIE	35764	I for sure won that one!	Chuckie.yack	143
BOYBRUSH	35765	In your dreams!	Chuckie.yack	144
CHUCKIE	35766	I'm so the best at this!	Chuckie.yack	148
BOYBRUSH	35767	Almost as good as me!	Chuckie.yack	149
CHUCKIE	35768	Okay that was a good comeback.	Chuckie.yack	153
BOYBRUSH	35769	I know!	Chuckie.yack	154
DEE	39150	You guys are both pretty weak.	Chuckie.yack	157
DEE	39151	You fight like kids.	Chuckie.yack	158
DEE	39152	I've seen better footwork from a footstool.	Chuckie.yack	159
DEE	39153	You guys give new meaning to the term “practice dummy.”	Chuckie.yack	160
DEE	39154	Your delivery is going to the wrong ZIP code.	Chuckie.yack	161
DEE	39155	You're as subtle as two rhinos at a tea party.	Chuckie.yack	162
DEE	39156	I can't decide if I'm watching a comedy or a tragedy.	Chuckie.yack	163
DEE	39157	The deadliest thing on that stage are your Scurvydogs.	Chuckie.yack	164
BOYBRUSH	35763	Well anyway that was fun.	Chuckie.yack	168
CHUCKIE	35770	I wonder where those two people we were following went?	Chuckie.yack	180
CHUCKIE	35771	This is the grossest outhouse ever in the whole history of gross outhouses.	Chuckie.yack	184
CHUCKIE	35772	I don't want to hang around in here anymore. The guy is eyeballing us.	Chuckie.yack	188
CHUCKIE	35773	I wonder where this path goes?	Chuckie.yack	194
CHUCKIE	35774	This place is fun!	Chuckie.yack	195

ELAINE	35992	I'm glad. Maybe a new hobby will help you get your mind off The Secret.	Chums.yack	82		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	35993	-ahem- Sure.	Chums.yack	83
ELAINE	35994	Well, let's hear what you got.	Chums.yack	84		UPDATE

FISHMONGER	36002	Have you a story to share?	Chums.yack	98
FISHER1	36003	And don't be nervous thinking it's a test to see whether you've mastered the art!	Chums.yack	101
FISHMONGER	36004	Even though that's just what it is.	Chums.yack	102
CURATOR	36005	What's that thing?	Chums.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	36006	Uh, nothing.	Chums.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	36007	I've got a story for your newsletter, if you're interested.	Chums.yack	108
CURATOR	36008	Let's hear it!	Chums.yack	109
GUYBRUSH	36009	One time...	Chums.yack	115
GUYBRUSH	36010	I had just broken through a blockade as thick and deadly as the crab bisque at the Scumm Bar...	Chums.yack	121
GUYBRUSH	36011	I had just broken through a blockade...	Chums.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	36012	The pirate hunter Morgan LeFlay had my first mate at sword-point...	Chums.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	36013	I was baitcasting dead-stick from a crow's nest with a googan called Flambe...	Chums.yack	126
GUYBRUSH	36014	I was up in a crow's nest with a demon lookout called Flambe...	Chums.yack	129
GUYBRUSH	36015	It was my first trip to Monkey Island. The crew were restless...	Chums.yack	131
GUYBRUSH	36016	I was in a park, talking to my son...	Chums.yack	132
BOYBRUSH	36017	Dad. Be serious.	Chums.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	36018	Okay, okay.	Chums.yack	141
GUYBRUSH	36019	And then all of a sudden...	Chums.yack	150
GUYBRUSH	36020	...my ship was swallowed by a manatee. A really, really big one!	Chums.yack	154
GUYBRUSH	36021	...my ship was swallowed by a whale!	Chums.yack	157
GUYBRUSH	36022	...my ship was swallowed by a titanic alabaster whale, with eyes like destiny, and skin tattooed by a hundred harpoons!	Chums.yack	160
GUYBRUSH	36023	...my ship was swallowed by a huge lunker of a whale, a real chum-chomping line-breaker if ever there was one.	Chums.yack	163
GUYBRUSH	36024	...our ship was attacked by an immense kraken with forty tentacles, like the writhing fingers of the sea itself, grasping to haul us down!	Chums.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	36025	...our ship was attacked by a huge kraken!	Chums.yack	169
GUYBRUSH	36026	...our stringer took a strike from a smoker that turned out to be a mermaid!	Chums.yack	171
GUYBRUSH	36027	...we ran across a mermaid stranded on a rock!	Chums.yack	175
GUYBRUSH	36028	Or maybe mer-person is more correct.	Chums.yack	178
GUYBRUSH	36029	A guy already inside thought I wanted to steal his girlfriend.	Chums.yack	184
GUYBRUSH	36030	Inside it was like walking on soft cheese, with rivers of pea soup that stank like a landlubber's baitbox.	Chums.yack	185
GUYBRUSH	36031	Inside it was like walking on soft cheese, with rivers of pea soup that stank like a bos'n's armpit.	Chums.yack	188
GUYBRUSH	36032	It was gross inside. Soft floors and yellow stuff all over the place.	Chums.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	36033	It began to crack the ship apart like four drunken wedding guests fighting over the last oyster.	Chums.yack	191
GUYBRUSH	36034	It started to crack the ship in half.	Chums.yack	193
GUYBRUSH	36035	The crew wanted to have her for dinner. I mistook what they meant.	Chums.yack	194
GUYBRUSH	36036	Morgan LeFlay and I said we were married so I'd seem unavailable!	Chums.yack	199
GUYBRUSH	36037	One false move and you'd be wearing Jonah's overcoat, a layer of greasy phlegm as thick as day-old pancake batter.	Chums.yack	202
GUYBRUSH	36038	I made a fishing line with my own hair!	Chums.yack	204
GUYBRUSH	36039	I lit the hull with Flambe's head, so it would burn underwater, blinding as the sun, and furious as the sea.	Chums.yack	205
GUYBRUSH	36040	I lit the hull on fire with Flambe's head, so it would burn underwater.	Chums.yack	208
GUYBRUSH	36041	Fortunately, the average salt can't tell the taste of mermaid from any grump you might find in your creel.	Chums.yack	210
GUYBRUSH	36042	Fortunately, most people have no idea what mermaid tastes like.	Chums.yack	213
ELAINE	36043	Which you were...	Chums.yack	219
GUYBRUSH	36044	Yes! Yes I was.	Chums.yack	220
GUYBRUSH	36045	And then we escaped. Through the digestive system. Ship and all.	Chums.yack	226
GUYBRUSH	36046	Then Morgan knocked me out and sold me to my enemies.	Chums.yack	227
GUYBRUSH	36047	Then we stuck an umbrella jighead in the beastie's mouth and reeled it in from the inside!	Chums.yack	229
GUYBRUSH	36048	We stuck a hook in the beastie's mouth and caught it from the inside!	Chums.yack	231
GUYBRUSH	36049	The creature lit out like an old tar from a bar of soap. Of course, then we had to put out the fire.	Chums.yack	232
GUYBRUSH	36050	The creature fled. Of course, then we had to put out the fire.	Chums.yack	234
GUYBRUSH	36051	I helped her escape when night fell. We still write from time to time.	Chums.yack	235
GUYBRUSH	36052	Sorry about your ship.	Chums.yack	243
YOUNGPIRATE4	36053	I'm not sure what a manatee is.	Chums.yack	248
YOUNGPIRATE4	36054	What on earth is a manatee? You lost me after that.	Chums.yack	249
ELAINE	36055	I'm not sure what a manatee is.	Chums.yack	250
ELAINE	36056	What on earth is a manatee? You lost me after that.	Chums.yack	251
LOCKSMITH	36057	I'm not sure what a manatee is.	Chums.yack	252
LOCKSMITH	36058	What on earth is a manatee? You lost me after that.	Chums.yack	253
YARDARM	36059	Ah, well, I'm not quite sure what a manatee is.	Chums.yack	254		UPDATE
YARDARM	36060	What on earth is a manatee? You lost me after that.	Chums.yack	255
GUARD	36061	I'm not sure what a manatee is.	Chums.yack	256		UPDATE
GUARD	36062	What on earth is a manatee? You lost me after that.	Chums.yack	257
FISHMONGER	36063	I thought we told you to not have it be a manatee.	Chums.yack	258		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	36064	Oh yeah. You did.	Chums.yack	259
CURATOR	36065	Hm. I'm not sure about the manatee. Not very piratey.	Chums.yack	260
YOUNGPIRATE4	36066	You know, what your story needs, is a part to set the stage, to let us know what's going on, and who the people are.	Chums.yack	279
YOUNGPIRATE4	36067	It should come at the beginning. Like, a, uh...	Chums.yack	280
GUYBRUSH	36068	A beginning?	Chums.yack	281
YOUNGPIRATE4	36069	Like a beginning, exactly!	Chums.yack	282
YOUNGPIRATE4	36070	Like, “I was on the deck of a burning Spanish galleon with Horseface and Itchy Joe. And then all of a sudden...”	Chums.yack	283
YOUNGPIRATE4	36071	...and then you take it from there.	Chums.yack	284
YOUNGPIRATE4	36072	Want to give it a try?	Chums.yack	285
YOUNGPIRATE4	36073	Yeah, that's the way!	Chums.yack	288
LOCKSMITH	36074	Hm. But then what?	Chums.yack	294
LOCKSMITH	36075	A key point of every fish story is a dramatic ending. Did you land the fish? Did it get away? Does someone get married, or killed, or both?	Chums.yack	295
LOCKSMITH	36076	People want to know how things turn out!	Chums.yack	296
GUYBRUSH	36077	That makes sense.	Chums.yack	297
LOCKSMITH	36078	Want to give it a try?	Chums.yack	298
LOCKSMITH	36079	I think you've got a lock on it.	Chums.yack	301
ELAINE	36080	That's nice, Guybrush, but I think you've left out the most interesting part.	Chums.yack	308
ELAINE	36081	What was it like inside the whale? What happened in there?	Chums.yack	309
ELAINE	36082	What was it like to have a kraken attacking your ship?	Chums.yack	310
ELAINE	36083	What was it like to meet a mermaid?	Chums.yack	311
ELAINE	36084	People want to hear about the experience.	Chums.yack	312
GUYBRUSH	36085	That makes sense.	Chums.yack	313
ELAINE	36086	Want to give it a try?	Chums.yack	314
ELAINE	36087	I think you've got it!	Chums.yack	317
YARDARM	36088	You know what, I think your story would really benefit from some colorful description.	Chums.yack	324
YARDARM	36089	Like, when I hook a fish, I don't just say I hooked a fish.	Chums.yack	325
YARDARM	36090	I say there was a majestic fish, glistening like liquid silver, dashing through the waves, stretching my line out like the truth in a schoolboy's mouth.	Chums.yack	326
GUYBRUSH	36091	Aha! That does seem a little more gripping.	Chums.yack	327
YARDARM	36092	Want to give it a try?	Chums.yack	328
YARDARM	36093	I'm not sure you're working enough colorful description into your story. Just a little bit would do.	Chums.yack	332
YARDARM	36094	Dazzling!	Chums.yack	335
GUARD	36095	Listen, let me tell you something about anglers.	Chums.yack	342
GUYBRUSH	36096	By which you mean people who fish.	Chums.yack	343
GUARD	36097	Right, but if you are one, you'd say “angler.”	Chums.yack	344
GUYBRUSH	36098	(unsure)I would.	Chums.yack	345
GUARD	36099	Every subculture has its own special language. Words with significance specific to that subculture.	Chums.yack	346
GUARD	36100	When you use them, you convey both meaning and membership.	Chums.yack	347
GUYBRUSH	36101	That sounds... good.	Chums.yack	348
GUARD	36102	That's why authentic-sounding fish stories always have plenty of angler lingo.	Chums.yack	349
GUARD	36103	For example, I wouldn't tell people a big fish broke my string, I'd say I was jigging with hard bait when a strike from a lunker snapped my leader.	Chums.yack	350
GUYBRUSH	36104	That's both highly specific and difficult to understand.	Chums.yack	351
GUARD	36105	Exactly the point.	Chums.yack	352
GUARD	36106	Want to give it a try?	Chums.yack	353
GUARD	36107	I don't think you're getting enough lingo in there. Just a little would be enough.	Chums.yack	357
GUARD	36108	Yeah, that's the way! You almost sound like a real angler!	Chums.yack	360
CURATOR	36109	Nice!	Chums.yack	373
CURATOR	36110	I think I could use that!	Chums.yack	374		UPDATE
CURATOR	36111	I'll get back to you.	Chums.yack	376
YOUNGPIRATE4	36112	You're not half bad at this. You should go talk to the three geezers at the fish shop.	Chums.yack	397
YOUNGPIRATE4	36113	And, uh, don't tell them I said they were geezers.	Chums.yack	398
LOCKSMITH	36114	You assemble the pieces very well. I think they'd appreciate your tales across the way at the fish shop.	Chums.yack	401
YARDARM	36115	You weave a story like a wicker placemat with a mosaic of coffee stains.	Chums.yack	404
GUYBRUSH	36116	Is that good?	Chums.yack	405
YARDARM	36117	Tightly woven and useful! The coffee stains give it character.	Chums.yack	406
YARDARM	36118	You should tell a story at the Cod's Wallop!	Chums.yack	407
ELAINE	36119	That was really good, sweetie!	Chums.yack	410
ELAINE	36120	You should tell a story to the Chums leadership at the Cod's Wallop fish shop!	Chums.yack	411
GUARD	36121	Yes, that one's a keeper. Pack it in your creel and take it to the fish shop on Mêlée.	Chums.yack	413
GUARD	36122	You might have reached your limit. I suggest you cast your line at the fish shop on Mêlée.	Chums.yack	414
YOUNGPIRATE4	36123	Obviously you're new at this. But don't worry. Other Chums can show you more of the ropes.	Chums.yack	423
LOCKSMITH	36124	I can tell it's early in your training. Find some other members of the Chums and they'll help you hone your skills.	Chums.yack	424
YARDARM	36125	You're still breaking out of the eggshell as a storyteller, but other Chums will help you strengthen your beak and talons.	Chums.yack	425
ELAINE	36126	I'm so happy you're pursuing a new skill! I'm not allowed to direct you to other Chums, but go out and find them, it'll be fun.	Chums.yack	426
GUARD	36127	Clearly you've got a lot to learn. You'll want to find some other Chums to practice on.	Chums.yack	427
FISHER1	36128	That's it, then?	Chums.yack	428
FISHMONGER	36129	Like we said, maybe go on out and find yourself some other Chums to talk to. Learn a few tricks of the yarn-spinning trade.	Chums.yack	429
GUYBRUSH	36130	Okay!	Chums.yack	431
YOUNGPIRATE4	36131	Your story's not bad, but it's missing a few things. Find some other Chums to help you fill in the gaps.	Chums.yack	436
LOCKSMITH	36132	Seems like you've got a few keys on your ring, now talk to some other Chums to round out the set.	Chums.yack	437
YARDARM	36133	I can see you're developing your flight feathers. Keep talking to other Chums and you'll really learn to soar!	Chums.yack	438
ELAINE	36134	I think this is really good for you. You should find some other Chums to share your gift with.	Chums.yack	439
GUARD	36135	I've given you my best tip. See if you can get some other Chums to do the same.	Chums.yack	440
FISHER1	36136	Aye, you've learned a few things now, you're well on your way. But there's more out there to know.	Chums.yack	441
GUYBRUSH	36137	I'll do that!	Chums.yack	443
YOUNGPIRATE4	36138	Pretty good yarn. You know who you should talk to?	Chums.yack	448
LOCKSMITH	36139	That was well executed. You know who you should talk to?	Chums.yack	449
YARDARM	36140	Your story, it's good, but it's like a butter knife in a bag of steak knives. You know who you should talk to?	Chums.yack	450		UPDATE
ELAINE	36141	This could be a whole new path for you, Guybrush. You know who you should talk to?	Chums.yack	451
GUARD	36142	Not a half bad story. You know who you should talk to?	Chums.yack	452
FISHER1	36143	You're coming along well, my lad. You know who you should talk to?	Chums.yack	453
YOUNGPIRATE4	36144	That lady who runs the locksmith shop. She knows a thing or two.	Chums.yack	456
YOUNGPIRATE4	36145	Elaine Marley! The scurvy lady?	Chums.yack	457
GUYBRUSH	36146	I've heard of her.	Chums.yack	458
YOUNGPIRATE4	36147	There's an old ghost who sails with that guy LeChuck, you can usually find him hanging from the yardarm.	Chums.yack	459
YOUNGPIRATE4	36148	The grumpy guy who guards the ice quarry on Brrr Muda.	Chums.yack	460
LOCKSMITH	36149	There's a pirate at the Scumm Bar. Tell her I sent you.	Chums.yack	464
LOCKSMITH	36150	Elaine Marley! She used to be the governor here, but I think she's on Scurvy Island these days.	Chums.yack	465
GUYBRUSH	36151	Yep.	Chums.yack	466
LOCKSMITH	36152	There's a yardarm hanger called Apple Bob. Not sure where to find him, exactly.	Chums.yack	467
GUYBRUSH	36153	I am, he's on LeChuck's ship.	Chums.yack	468
LOCKSMITH	36154	The guy who keeps the front gate of the ice quarry on Brrr Muda.	Chums.yack	469
LOCKSMITH	36155	Good customer.	Chums.yack	470
YARDARM	36156	There's a younger pirate, she wears her lure on her hat. She's usually at the Scumm Bar.	Chums.yack	474
YARDARM	36157	The proprietor of Smith's Locks on the Mêlée High Street.	Chums.yack	475
YARDARM	36158	Elaine. She's been a member for years. LeChuck doesn't know, so don't say anything if you see him.	Chums.yack	476
GUYBRUSH	36159	Likewise.	Chums.yack	477
YARDARM	36160	The ice quarry guard on Brrr Muda. He's nicer than he sounds. Or looks. Or acts.	Chums.yack	478
ELAINE	36161	Yasmine Tazi. Good pirate, great card player, grog connoisseur.	Chums.yack	482
ELAINE	36162	You can probably find her at the Scumm Bar, she practically lives there.	Chums.yack	483
ELAINE	36163	Locke Smith, at Smith's Locks on Mêlée!	Chums.yack	484
ELAINE	36164	Apple Bob. You'll have to go back to LeChuck's ship, of course, but he's worth it.	Chums.yack	485
ELAINE	36165	Antonio Planke. He guards the ice quarry on Brrr Muda. Really knows his stuff.	Chums.yack	486
GUARD	36166	The young woman at the Scumm Bar on Mêlée Island with the lure on her hat. Don't tell her I sent you.	Chums.yack	490
GUARD	36167	The woman who runs the locksmith on Mêlée Island. Don't tell her I sent you.	Chums.yack	491
GUARD	36168	Elaine Marley. She's kind of famous but she's nice, she might see you.	Chums.yack	492
GUYBRUSH	36169	She just might.	Chums.yack	493
GUARD	36170	There's a crazy old yardarm hanger, Bob something, I think he sails with Captain LeChuck.	Chums.yack	494
GUYBRUSH	36171	Apple Bob.	Chums.yack	495
GUARD	36172	Sounds right.	Chums.yack	496
FISHER1	36173	The young pirate at the Scumm Bar, I think I mentioned her when we first told you about the Chums.	Chums.yack	501
FISHER1	36174	The locksmith across the street!	Chums.yack	502
FISHER1	36175	Your wife, Elaine. You must know she's been a member for years.	Chums.yack	503
GUYBRUSH	36176	Yyyyes. Of course, I knew that.	Chums.yack	504
FISHER1	36177	That old tar Apple Bob.	Chums.yack	505
FISHMONGER	36178	Aye, Bob. Ghostly fella, works with LeChuck, but don't hold that against him. He'll help you.	Chums.yack	506
FISHER1	36179	The guard at the ice quarry on Brrr Muda. He's always a treat at the annual meeting.	Chums.yack	507
GUYBRUSH	36180	Thanks!	Chums.yack	510
GUYBRUSH	36181	Okay!	Chums.yack	517
GUYBRUSH	36182	Nah, I think I've got it.	Chums.yack	518
YOUNGPIRATE4	36183	Okay then.	Chums.yack	520
LOCKSMITH	36184	Some other time.	Chums.yack	521
YARDARM	36185	Good luck.	Chums.yack	522
ELAINE	36186	Okay.	Chums.yack	523
GUARD	36187	All right.	Chums.yack	524
FISHER1	36188	You've an interesting style, Threepwood.	Chums.yack	531
FISHMONGER	36189	Of course you've already proved yourself to us.	Chums.yack	532
FISHER1	36190	That's a fine story, but it doesn't sound like a tale told by an angler, truth be told.	Chums.yack	536
FISHER1	36191	Aye, the pieces are all there, but it's a bit flat, isn't it? Lacking descriptive power, as they say.	Chums.yack	541
FISHER1	36192	I was confused by the Morgan character, she just appears in the story without any introduction.	Chums.yack	546
FISHMONGER	36193	Aye.	Chums.yack	547
FISHER1	36194	I was confused by the Flambe character, who just appears in the story without any introduction.	Chums.yack	552
FISHMONGER	36195	Aye.	Chums.yack	553
FISHER1	36196	I wasn't sure why you were mentioning mermaids when there hadn't been one in the story?	Chums.yack	558
FISHER1	36197	That was a whopper of a story!	Chums.yack	563
FISHMONGER	36198	You've clearly learned all there is to learn. I hereby declare you to be a Chum Grand Master! Congratulations!	Chums.yack	572
GUYBRUSH	36199	Wow! Thank you! That's a great honor!	Chums.yack	573
FISHMONGER	36200	And, uh, I know I said there wouldn't be no reward for success with the Chums, but it's quite an achievement.	Chums.yack	576
FISHMONGER	36201	So we'll be giving you this commemorative trophy.	Chums.yack	577
GUYBRUSH	36202	Aw, thanks, guys, I'm touched.	Chums.yack	591

COOK	34637	Guybrush Threepwood, as I live and breathe! How've you been?	Cook.yack	45
GUYBRUSH	34638	Fine.	Cook.yack	46
GUYBRUSH	34639	Good.	Cook.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	34640	Peachy.	Cook.yack	48
GUYBRUSH	34641	Same old same old.	Cook.yack	49
COOK	34642	How's Elaine? She was always my favorite governor. Also, she covered your tab when you stopped coming in.	Cook.yack	52
GUYBRUSH	34643	She's good, no pieces missing.	Cook.yack	54
COOK	34644	Kids yet?	Cook.yack	55
GUYBRUSH	34645	{handsup}Whoa! Easy there, tiger.	Cook.yack	56
GUYBRUSH	34646	I'm still in my juvenile phase myself.	Cook.yack	57
GUYBRUSH	34647	That's what Elaine says, anyway.	Cook.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	34648	Still in public service, fighting scurvy now.	Cook.yack	59
COOK	34649	(worried)My place is clean! Our health certificates are up to date.	Cook.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	34650	It's not like that. She's got a foundation, they're trying to promote limes as a preventative.	Cook.yack	61
COOK	34651	Oh!	Cook.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	34652	I screwed up our anniversary.	Cook.yack	63
COOK	34653	Forgot the date?	Cook.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	34654	Remembered the date. Forgot an important allergy.	Cook.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	34655	She's fully recovered.	Cook.yack	66
GUYBRUSH	34656	We're apart more often than I'd like.	Cook.yack	67
COOK	34657	But you're still...	Cook.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	34658	Oh yeah, we're still.	Cook.yack	69
GUYBRUSH	34659	We've just each got a lot on our plate. It's a two-plate relationship.	Cook.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	34660	{happy}She's here on the island!	Cook.yack	71
COOK	34661	Well of course, she came with you.	Cook.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	34662	No, I didn't even know she'd be here.	Cook.yack	73
COOK	34663	(concerned)Oh!	Cook.yack	74
COOK	34664	Well, tell her I say hello.	Cook.yack	76
GUYBRUSH	34665	{question}Do you know where I can buy a mop?	Cook.yack	81
COOK	34666	Buy? You don't want to buy a mop.	Cook.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	34667	I think I do.	Cook.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	34668	What was that you were trying to tell me about mops before?	Cook.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	34669	Can we talk about mops some more?	Cook.yack	87
COOK	34670	I'm always happy to talk mop shop! What do you want to know?	Cook.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	34671	The atmosphere in the bar is different than it used to be.	Cook.yack	90
COOK	34672	Yeah. I don't like it, but I've got to cater to the new crowd. Everything changes, Guybrush.	Cook.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	34673	But the roaches stay the same.	Cook.yack	92
COOK	34674	I've missed your wit. And your low alcohol tolerance.	Cook.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	34675	Hey!	Cook.yack	94
GUYBRUSH	34676	Those new pirate leaders seem like real jerks.	Cook.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	34677	Why do you even let them in the bar?	Cook.yack	97
COOK	34678	Well, they've driven off my old regulars, so I don't have a lot of choice if I want to stay in business.	Cook.yack	98
COOK	34679	Also if I tried to get them to leave they'd probably cut me up and throw me in the soup.	Cook.yack	99
COOK	34680	Frankly, I'm terrified of them.	Cook.yack	100
COOK	34681	On the plus side, they have more disposable income and better hygiene than the old crowd.	Cook.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	34682	{proud}Did I mention I'm going to find The Secret of Monkey Island?	Cook.yack	103
COOK	34683	No, I don't think you did! That's exciting!	Cook.yack	105
COOK	38997	So, you'll be hiring a ship at the docks?	Cook.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	38998	I'm thinking I'll steal one.	Cook.yack	107
COOK	38999	As far as I know, the only ship out there is LeChuck's.	Cook.yack	108
GUYBRUSH	39000	Even better. Two birds with one stone.	Cook.yack	109
GUYBRUSH	39001	I'm going to steal LeChuck's.	Cook.yack	110
COOK	39002	Bold! I like your thinking.	Cook.yack	111
GUYBRUSH	34697	I think I hear the health inspector!	Cook.yack	113
COOK	34698	WHAT?! WHERE?!	Cook.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	34699	{happy}Just kidding. Ha! That joke never gets old.	Cook.yack	116
COOK	34700	Phew.	Cook.yack	117
GUYBRUSH	34701	Keep up the good work!	Cook.yack	119
COOK	34702	Thanks, will do.	Cook.yack	120
COOK	34703	Hey! You can't take that! Make your own!	Cook.yack	144
GUYBRUSH	34704	Can I borrow your mop?	Cook.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	34705	Will you advance me the down payment on a ship if I help you clean up?	Cook.yack	167
COOK	34706	Put that down before you hurt yourself!	Cook.yack	168
GUYBRUSH	34707	What?	Cook.yack	169
COOK	34708	Clearly there's a lot you don't know about mops.	Cook.yack	170
GUYBRUSH	34709	Honestly I think I prefer to keep it that way.	Cook.yack	190
COOK	34710	(rebuffed)Hmph.	Cook.yack	191
COOK	34711	I said not to touch that! You don't use someone else's mop!	Cook.yack	208
GUYBRUSH	34712	Why not?	Cook.yack	209
COOK	34713	The mop is the formal tool of a cook.	Cook.yack	227
COOK	34714	[center]Not as clumsy or random as a dishrag.	Cook.yack	237
COOK	34715	[center]An elegant tool for a more civilized cleaning.	Cook.yack	249
COOK	34716	You cannot hope to succeed with the mop of another.	Cook.yack	259
GUYBRUSH	34717	I can't?	Cook.yack	262
COOK	34718	[center]You must construct your own, a single perfect instrument that you will keep and use for a lifetime.	Cook.yack	265
GUYBRUSH	34719	Well let's hope it doesn't come to that!	Cook.yack	284
COOK	34720	Once you build it the mop will become your constant companion, your tool...	Cook.yack	286
COOK	34721	[center]...and a ready means of defense against spills of all kinds.	Cook.yack	290
GUYBRUSH	34722	Uh...	Cook.yack	302
GUYBRUSH	34723	...build it?	Cook.yack	305
COOK	40144	meditative deep breath in	Cook.yack	311
COOK	40145	meditative deep breath out	Cook.yack	313
COOK	34724	[center]The wood is the heart of the handle. The heart is the handle of the cook.	Cook.yack	315
COOK	34725	[center]You are one.	Cook.yack	321
GUYBRUSH	34726	Not helpful so far.	Cook.yack	328
COOK	34727	You must find a particular tree, a tree uniquely suited to the handles of mops.	Cook.yack	329
COOK	34728	Carve your handle from a limb of that tree.	Cook.yack	334
COOK	34729	Any questions?	Cook.yack	362
GUYBRUSH	34730	How do I find the mop-handle tree?	Cook.yack	366
GUYBRUSH	34731	Remind me how to find the mop-handle tree?	Cook.yack	367
GUYBRUSH	34732	What kind of wood is the tree?	Cook.yack	368
COOK	34733	That is something you must discover for yourself.	Cook.yack	369
GUYBRUSH	34734	What kind of wood did you say the tree was?	Cook.yack	371
COOK	34735	I didn't.	Cook.yack	372
GUYBRUSH	34736	What about the head of the mop?	Cook.yack	374
COOK	34737	Oh, you have to have one of course, but pretty much anything will do. It's mostly about the handle.	Cook.yack	375
GUYBRUSH	34738	Are you sure I can't just buy a mop?	Cook.yack	377
GUYBRUSH	34739	Yours, for example?	Cook.yack	378
COOK	34740	No! You've got to make one. Trust me on this.	Cook.yack	379
GUYBRUSH	34741	Nope, I'm good.	Cook.yack	381
GUYBRUSH	34742	Okay, I guess I'll do it.	Cook.yack	382
GUYBRUSH	34743	Never mind.	Cook.yack	383
GUYBRUSH	34744	Okay, thanks.	Cook.yack	384
COOK	34745	I can't tell you exactly where it is, because this is your own personal journey.	Cook.yack	387
GUYBRUSH	34746	What's wrong?	Cook.yack	398
BOYBRUSH	34747	You gave this story the wrong title. It should be called “Mop Quest.”	Cook.yack	400
BOYBRUSH	34748	When do we get to the piratey parts?	Cook.yack	402
GUYBRUSH	34749	Even the coolest professions involve more mopping up than you would think.	Cook.yack	404
GUYBRUSH	34750	It seemed crazy to me at the time, too, but don't forget it was all so I could board a ship, take command, and sail to Monkey Island.	Cook.yack	406
GUYBRUSH	34751	But first, I had to make a mop.	Cook.yack	408
GUYBRUSH	34752	You look like the health inspector tasted your stew. Or you did.	Cook.yack	426
COOK	34753	Worse!	Cook.yack	427
COOK	34754	Marlon Marlin is here!	Cook.yack	428
GUYBRUSH	34755	Who?	Cook.yack	429
COOK	34756	The customer I have nightmares about.	Cook.yack	430
COOK	34757	He's the only importer of yak fat on the island so I need to keep him happy, but he makes that impossible!	Cook.yack	431
COOK	34758	Today he wants me to make him a dish that he ate last week at some kind of event at the governor's mansion.	Cook.yack	432
COOK	34759	But of course he doesn't remember what it's called, or know what's in it, or even remember what color it was.	Cook.yack	433
COOK	34760	He says he thinks it has “ingredients” in it!	Cook.yack	434		UPDATE
COOK	34761	I don't have the slightest idea what to make.	Cook.yack	435
GUYBRUSH	34762	How's it going with that nightmare customer guy?	Cook.yack	437
COOK	34763	My stomach feels like it's full of cannonballs and splintered rowboats.	Cook.yack	438
GUYBRUSH	34764	Good news, I have a cookbook!	Cook.yack	442
GUYBRUSH	34765	Where did he say he had the dish he wants you to make?	Cook.yack	445
COOK	34766	At the governor's mansion. It's probably some exotic, weird-tasting thing from a swanky cookbook.	Cook.yack	446
GUYBRUSH	34767	If I brought you a recipe, could you make it?	Cook.yack	448
COOK	34768	Of course! I'm a cook. See the hat?	Cook.yack	450
GUYBRUSH	34769	{point}Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!	Cook.yack	452
COOK	34770	I do know a great stew recipe for monkey heads, but I can't think about that right now.	Cook.yack	453
GUYBRUSH	34771	What was that you were trying to tell me about mops before?	Cook.yack	455
GUYBRUSH	34772	Can I ask you again about the mop I need to make?	Cook.yack	456
COOK	34773	Sure.	Cook.yack	457
GUYBRUSH	34774	I'll see what I can find out.	Cook.yack	459
COOK	34775	Thanks.	Cook.yack	460
GUYBRUSH	34776	Busy?	Cook.yack	467		DELETE
COOK	34777	Yep!	Cook.yack	468

GUYBRUSH	34779	Can I ask you again about the mop I need to make?	Cook.yack	478
COOK	34780	Sure.	Cook.yack	479
GUYBRUSH	34781	Okay, see you around.	Cook.yack	481
COOK	34783	(of course I felt the earthquake you dolt)I was too busy running for my life.	Cook.yack	495
GUYBRUSH	34784	I hear patio dining is all the rage these days.	Cook.yack	499
GUYBRUSH	34785	You could think of this as a head start on renovations.	Cook.yack	500
COOK	34786	Insurance would probably have helped.	Cook.yack	502
GUYBRUSH	40823	(casual small talk)Did you feel the earthquake?	Cook.yack	503
GUYBRUSH	34787	You should probably put out the rest of these flames.	Cook.yack	506
COOK	34788	Thanks, I'll do that.	Cook.yack	508
COOK	34789	I think I'll add patio dining.	Cook.yack	513
COOK	34790	I think what we need is a day care for the little tykes.	Cook.yack	514
COOK	34791	What we really need is a buffet.	Cook.yack	515
COOK	34792	An all you can drink grog machine!	Cook.yack	516

GUYBRUSH	34808	Cool.	Cook.yack	540
GUYBRUSH	34809	Why?	Cook.yack	541
COOK	34810	Excellent question.	Cook.yack	542

COOK	34817	But in a crisis, you don't think. There isn't time. You just act. And by acting, you expose your inner self. Heroism and villainy are revealed in moments like these.	Cook.yack	549
COOK	34818	Me, I saved the cookbook.	Cook.yack	550
COOK	34819	You're welcome.	Cook.yack	552

CURATOR	37040	Welcome to the Mêlée Island Museum of Pirate Lore!	Curator.yack	30
CURATOR	37041	I'm Conrad, the curator and docent here.	Curator.yack	31
CURATOR	37042	I also edit the Pirate Times newsletter! Here, take my business card.	Curator.yack	33
GUYBRUSH	37043	Er... thanks.	Curator.yack	40
CURATOR	39336	{enthused}The museum showcases the largest collection of pirate memorabilia in the Caribbean, or, on Mêlée Island at the very least.	Curator.yack	43
CURATOR	39337	The provenance of each item has been very carefully researched and fact-checked by myself and my team.	Curator.yack	44
CURATOR	39338	Authenticity is our watchword and our pledge.	Curator.yack	45
CURATOR	37044	Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions, just ask.	Curator.yack	46
GUYBRUSH	37045	I'm Guybrush Threepwood.	Curator.yack	57
CURATOR	37046	No kidding? Wow!	Curator.yack	59
CURATOR	37047	Are you named after Guybrush Threepwood?	Curator.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	37048	Uh... I guess you could say that?	Curator.yack	61
CURATOR	37049	Nice.	Curator.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	37050	{proud}I'm going to find the legendary Secret of Monkey Island!	Curator.yack	64
CURATOR	37051	Oh, that's excellent! Super retro.	Curator.yack	68
CURATOR	37052	If you need a place to display it, I know a convenient museum!	Curator.yack	69
GUYBRUSH	37053	Your museum is... quaint.	Curator.yack	71
CURATOR	37054	Thanks! It's been a personal passion of mine.	Curator.yack	73
CURATOR	37055	I'm nuts about old-timey pirate stuff!	Curator.yack	74
GUYBRUSH	37056	{confused}“Old-timey”?	Curator.yack	75
CURATOR	37057	Being around it really makes you feel like you're a part of something, doesn't it?	Curator.yack	76		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37058	I am part of something.	Curator.yack	77
CURATOR	37059	Exactly!	Curator.yack	78
GUYBRUSH	37060	Are any of these things valuable?	Curator.yack	80
CURATOR	37061	The security parrot isn't just here to look piratey.	Curator.yack	83
CURATOR	37062	Jon Laney's eyepatch is irreplaceable. It's the highlight of the collection.	Curator.yack	84
CURATOR	37063	{enthused}Amazingly, I got it at a yard sale. They didn't know what they had!	Curator.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	37064	I don't suppose you have a mop from a famous pirate swabbie on display?	Curator.yack	87
CURATOR	37065	I've been trying to get the cook down at the Scumm Bar to donate his, but he won't part with it.	Curator.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	37066	Do you have maps of the forest here?	Curator.yack	90
CURATOR	37067	No, that's not really what we do. Try the map shop in town?	Curator.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	37068	Tell me about that newsletter of yours?	Curator.yack	93
CURATOR	37069	The Pirate Times!	Curator.yack	94
CURATOR	37070	We publish pirate news, pirate stories, pirate poetry...	Curator.yack	95
CURATOR	37071	...all things piratey, really.	Curator.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	37072	{point_down45}I see you wear a pegleg despite having both of your original legs.	Curator.yack	98
CURATOR	37073	Just part of the docent's outfit. For the tourists. Kids always want to try it on!	Curator.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	37074	That's charming and creepy at the same time.	Curator.yack	101
CURATOR	37075	This is a museum for people who think attacking ships and murdering the crew for profit sounds “fun.”	Curator.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	37076	Touché.	Curator.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	37077	I'll have a look around.	Curator.yack	105
CURATOR	37078	Please do!	Curator.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	37079	Watcha working on?	Curator.yack	110
CURATOR	37080	Crossword puzzle.	Curator.yack	111
CURATOR	37081	What's a six-letter word for pirate?	Curator.yack	113
GUYBRUSH	37082	{thinking}Pirate.	Curator.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	37083	Do you get a lot of people in here?	Curator.yack	116
CURATOR	37084	This is the off-season.	Curator.yack	117
GUYBRUSH	37085	What's this melted lump of metal?	Curator.yack	126
GUYBRUSH	37086	Tell me again about the mug?	Curator.yack	128
CURATOR	37087	It used to be a mug, it was melted by some kind of acid.	Curator.yack	130
CURATOR	37088	It was found in the Mêlée jail many years ago, after an incident where like twenty pirates escaped!	Curator.yack	131
GUYBRUSH	37089	{brag}Hey, I did that!	Curator.yack	137
GUYBRUSH	37090	I had to keep pouring the grog from mug to mug because it was melting them.	Curator.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	37091	{handsup}I had an armload of mugs and I juggled them all the way from the Scumm Bar to the jail.	Curator.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	37092	All so I could get Otis to join my crew!	Curator.yack	141
GUYBRUSH	37093	Not my greatest decision, in retrospect.	Curator.yack	144
CURATOR	37094	That's a pretty wild story.	Curator.yack	145
GUYBRUSH	37095	It was just one pirate actually.	Curator.yack	149
CURATOR	37096	No, I'm pretty sure it was twenty.	Curator.yack	150
GUYBRUSH	37097	What's the story with the wanted poster?	Curator.yack	156
GUYBRUSH	37098	Tell me again about the wanted poster?	Curator.yack	158
CURATOR	37099	That is the earliest known wanted poster for Captain Kate Capsize.	Curator.yack	160
CURATOR	37100	{enthused}You can tell how notorious she was by the huge number of crimes listed there. Very impressive.	Curator.yack	161
CURATOR	37101	I got it from a collector on Phatt Island.	Curator.yack	162		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	39618	Those are my own crimes, actually.	Curator.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	39619	{proud}I was pretty much public enemy number one on Phatt Island at the time.	Curator.yack	168
GUYBRUSH	37105	I stuck Kate's picture on there so she'd get thrown in jail.	Curator.yack	169
CURATOR	37106	Ha ha ha! That would never work, nobody's that clueless in real life.	Curator.yack	172		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37107	That's a nice oar.	Curator.yack	177
GUYBRUSH	37108	Tell me again about the oar?	Curator.yack	179
CURATOR	37109	The one with the coffin, yeah!	Curator.yack	181
GUYBRUSH	37110	That's a nice coffin.	Curator.yack	187
GUYBRUSH	37111	Tell me again about the coffin?	Curator.yack	189
CURATOR	37112	The one with the oar, yeah!	Curator.yack	191
CURATOR	37113	The coffin had a lot of water damage when I got it from the Voodoo Lady in town, but I managed to restore it.	Curator.yack	195
CURATOR	37114	{enthused}It was used by a certain well-known captain in a daring escape from a Turkish prison!	Curator.yack	196
GUYBRUSH	37115	The water damage is actually from the swamp on Scabb Island.	Curator.yack	200
CURATOR	37116	Unlikely, the prison in question is nowhere near Scabb Island.	Curator.yack	201
GUYBRUSH	37117	{surprised}HOW ON EARTH DO YOU HAVE THAT NOTE?!	Curator.yack	207
GUYBRUSH	37118	Tell me again about the note?	Curator.yack	209
CURATOR	37119	{enthused}Oh yeah, that's very interesting!	Curator.yack	211
CURATOR	37120	That was found tucked inside of a book at the Phatt Island Library.	Curator.yack	212		UPDATE
CURATOR	37121	It's the actual note left by the ghost pirate LeChuck when he kidnapped Governor Marley!	Curator.yack	213
GUYBRUSH	37122	{confused}I KNOW WHAT IT IS!	Curator.yack	217
GUYBRUSH	37123	The lookout handed it to me just before I finished my three trials!	Curator.yack	218
GUYBRUSH	37124	I was crushed! But undaunted. I gathered a crew and I sailed to Monkey Island to save her!	Curator.yack	219
GUYBRUSH	37125	Not that she needed it, as it turned out.	Curator.yack	220
CURATOR	37126	Wow, man, you're really into this! I've got a role-playing group on Thursday nights...	Curator.yack	221
GUYBRUSH	37127	That map looks familiar.	Curator.yack	227
GUYBRUSH	37128	Tell me again about the map?	Curator.yack	229
CURATOR	37129	{enthused}That's one quarter of the original map to the treasure of Big Whoop!	Curator.yack	231
CURATOR	37130	I got it from the cartographer on Low Street. Apparently he was somehow involved in the search for Big Whoop.	Curator.yack	235
GUYBRUSH	37131	About all Wally managed to do was get kidnapped by LeChuck's henchmen.	Curator.yack	236
CURATOR	37132	That's not the way he tells it.	Curator.yack	237
GUYBRUSH	37133	You don't believe me?	Curator.yack	244
CURATOR	37134	It's not a question of belief.	Curator.yack	245
GUYBRUSH	37135	Never mind, it's not important.	Curator.yack	246
GUYBRUSH	37136	{defiant}I'm telling you the truth!	Curator.yack	250
CURATOR	37137	I'm sure you are. But it just doesn't quite square with the official record, so it's hard to substantiate.	Curator.yack	251		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37138	Substantiate? You've got an eye witness!	Curator.yack	252
CURATOR	37139	Eye witnesses are notoriously inaccurate. Human memory is plastic and suggestible.	Curator.yack	253
GUYBRUSH	37140	Not yours, apparently.	Curator.yack	254
CURATOR	37141	No, of course not. I deal in facts.	Curator.yack	255
GUYBRUSH	37142	{frustration}This is absurd. It's like this whole wall is stuff from my personal adventures, but somehow I'm not even mentioned in your stories!	Curator.yack	259
CURATOR	37143	That's what's so great about this museum! Everyone makes their own connections with the exhibits, and it's highly personal and different for everyone.	Curator.yack	260		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37144	That's not what I'm trying to say at all!	Curator.yack	261
CURATOR	37145	That's okay, you don't need to say anything. Just listen to what the exhibits tell you.	Curator.yack	262
GUYBRUSH	37146	(gritting teeth)Fine.	Curator.yack	265
GUYBRUSH	37147	I'm just trying to help.	Curator.yack	274
CURATOR	37148	Thanks, I've got it under control.	Curator.yack	275
GUYBRUSH	37149	You should think about hiring a research assistant.	Curator.yack	279
CURATOR	37150	Oh, I did! Unpaid, of course. Intern.	Curator.yack	280
GUYBRUSH	37151	I would think you'd care more about accuracy. What kind of a museum is this?	Curator.yack	284
CURATOR	37152	Museum of Pirate Lore!	Curator.yack	285
CURATOR	37153	Did you miss the sign on the way in?	Curator.yack	286
GUYBRUSH	37154	Crossword?	Curator.yack	295
CURATOR	37155	No, as a matter of fact.	Curator.yack	296
CURATOR	37156	I'm working on acquisition leads.	Curator.yack	297
CURATOR	37157	The museum hasn't got a centerpiece now, because -someone- walked away with my eyepatch!	Curator.yack	298
CURATOR	37158	(accusing)I'm not sure how they got past the guard parrot but rest assured I'll be beefing up security immediately.	Curator.yack	299
GUYBRUSH	37159	Good idea.	Curator.yack	300
GUYBRUSH	37160	You look busy.	Curator.yack	302
CURATOR	37161	I am.	Curator.yack	303
GUYBRUSH	37162	I see you've made some improvements.	Curator.yack	316
CURATOR	37163	Yeah! The museum is now the proud owner of one of Bella Fisher's original pirate flags!	Curator.yack	317
CURATOR	37164	{enthused}There are only three known to exist! It's a real score, incredibly valuable.	Curator.yack	318
GUYBRUSH	37165	Wow! I sure hope nobody steals that.	Curator.yack	319
CURATOR	37166	I've doubled my security. You can't be too careful.	Curator.yack	320
CURATOR	37167	Hey, have you found The Secret of Monkey Island yet?	Curator.yack	325
GUYBRUSH	37168	I'm close.	Curator.yack	326
CURATOR	37169	Well, keep me posted. I'd love to have it for the museum.	Curator.yack	327
GUYBRUSH	37170	You'll be the first to know.	Curator.yack	328
GUYBRUSH	37171	You look busy.	Curator.yack	330
CURATOR	37172	I am.	Curator.yack	331
GUYBRUSH	37173	Your pirate flag doesn't look quite right. Is it a replica?	Curator.yack	338
CURATOR	37174	You have a good eye, you should curate a museum.	Curator.yack	339
CURATOR	37175	The real one is too valuable to keep out here. I've got it locked in the storeroom.	Curator.yack	340
CURATOR	37176	There's already been an attempted theft!	Curator.yack	341
GUYBRUSH	37177	Any chance you'll have the real flag on display any time soon?	Curator.yack	344
CURATOR	37178	Oh, no. Too valuable. It definitely stays in the storeroom.	Curator.yack	345
GUYBRUSH	39339	Would you like this for your newsletter?	Curator.yack	352
GUYBRUSH	39340	Would you like this for the museum?	Curator.yack	353
GUYBRUSH	39341	It's the personal diary of the infamous ghost zombie demon pirate LeChuck.	Curator.yack	354
CURATOR	39342	Hey, cool!	Curator.yack	357
CURATOR	39343	I mean, there's no way it's the real thing, of course.	Curator.yack	358
CURATOR	39344	But I've been thinking about adding a room with stuff for kids to play with, it would go great in there.	Curator.yack	359
CURATOR	39345	And only a fool would publish LeChuck's real diary, that would get you killed!	Curator.yack	360		UPDATE
CURATOR	39346	But I'm sure my readers will love it. I think I can get a six-part series out of it in the fiction section.	Curator.yack	361
CURATOR	39347	Thanks a lot!	Curator.yack	362

GUYBRUSH	34567	Sounds like a reasonable law.	Customs.yack	47
JUDGE	34568	You will have to turn back, failure to do so will result in fines, incarceration and/or scurvy.	Customs.yack	48

GUYBRUSH	34581	Does it help if I'm a mighty pirate?	Customs.yack	112
JUDGE	34582	No.	Customs.yack	113
JUDGE	34583	You forgot to check that you're carrying limes. I'll check that for you.	Customs.yack	116
JUDGE	34584	Hmm...	Customs.yack	117
JUDGE	34585	Good answer...	Customs.yack	118
JUDGE	34586	Interesting you would check that one...	Customs.yack	119

VOODOOLADY	30317	Ah! The famous eyepatch disguise of Jon Laney.	Disguise.dinky	23
VOODOOLADY	30318	As I suspected, the magic has long since drained away. One moment.	Disguise.dinky	36
GUYBRUSH	30319	There you go. “Bite of a Thousand Needles.”	Disguise.dinky	45
VOODOOLADY	30320	Tell me, is this an ancient, powerful charm, or simply a plant you found in the forest?	Disguise.dinky	47
GUYBRUSH	30321	You were pretty opaque about what you wanted, even for you. I took my best shot.	Disguise.dinky	49
VOODOOLADY	30322	Very well. You've always been the “close enough” sort.	Disguise.dinky	51
GUYBRUSH	30323	Thanks!	Disguise.dinky	53
VOODOOLADY	30324	(to the spirits) Come, spirits of deception and death, drink your rejuvenation and awaken.	Disguise.dinky	69
GUYBRUSH	30325	{shocked}Death?	Disguise.dinky	74
VOODOOLADY	30326	It's nothing to worry about.	Disguise.dinky	78
VOODOOLADY	30327	(to the spirits) Jon Laney, this hapless boy needs your help...	Disguise.dinky	80
GUYBRUSH	30328	{defiant}Hey!	Disguise.dinky	82
VOODOOLADY	30329	(to the spirits) ...take pity on him, and bring him the power to hide from his enemies.	Disguise.dinky	84
GUYBRUSH	30330	{question}You don't have to put it like that...	Disguise.dinky	86
GUYBRUSH	30331	That's it?	Disguise.dinky	107
VOODOOLADY	30332	Unless you want the extended service warranty.	Disguise.dinky	109
GUYBRUSH	30333	No thanks, I'm not a sucker. What do I owe you?	Disguise.dinky	112
VOODOOLADY	30334	Maybe try it on first, before we discuss payment.	Disguise.dinky	121
GUYBRUSH	30335	Well? How do I look?	Disguise.dinky	129
GUYBRUSH	39492	Yaah!	Disguise.dinky	137
GUYBRUSH	30336	{shocked}What the heck? I look like a zombie! Is it broken?	Disguise.dinky	142
VOODOOLADY	30337	{nonchalant}One does the best one can with the materials provided.	Disguise.dinky	146
VOODOOLADY	30338	Jon Laney was especially known for impersonating monsters of various types.	Disguise.dinky	149
GUYBRUSH	30339	{upset}You failed to mention that earlier.	Disguise.dinky	151
VOODOOLADY	30340	{nonchalant}It's not a strong part of the sales pitch.	Disguise.dinky	153
GUYBRUSH	30341	I'll just wear it when I really need to.	Disguise.dinky	156
GUYBRUSH	39493	Blech.	Disguise.dinky	161

GUYBRUSH	32508	Are you done with the cookbook? I'd like it back.	Dock.dinky	494

ELAINE	34090	I've got to come up with a way to deal with Captain Madison, though.	Elaine.yack	80
ELAINE	34091	The pressure she's putting on the town is making it hard for social programs like mine.	Elaine.yack	81
ELAINE	34092	No, silly, I came on a charter just like you.	Elaine.yack	87
GUYBRUSH	34093	I figured that, but it never hurts to ask.	Elaine.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	34094	{thinking}I'm finding it harder than I thought to get hold of a ship and a crew for my expedition.	Elaine.yack	89
GUYBRUSH	34095	The new local leadership was less than supportive.	Elaine.yack	90
ELAINE	38969	Why don't you ask around at the docks? I'm sure you can find something.	Elaine.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	38970	Thanks, I'll try that.	Elaine.yack	92
ELAINE	34096	I've known you a long time. Try me.	Elaine.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	34097	{point_up}I'm planning to sign on to LeChuck's crew, mutiny them, and take the ship.	Elaine.yack	102
ELAINE	34098	Oh dear. Isn't there an easier way?	Elaine.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	34099	Trust me, that IS the easy way.	Elaine.yack	104
ELAINE	34100	I don't like her. She's the one who pushed to shut down the shipyard.	Elaine.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	34101	She doesn't understand the value of The Secret of Monkey Island!	Elaine.yack	111
ELAINE	34102	She laughed at me!	Elaine.yack	112
GUYBRUSH	34103	Me too!	Elaine.yack	113
ELAINE	34104	Obviously the woman has no taste and a lousy sense of humor.	Elaine.yack	114

GUYBRUSH	34113	Um... I'll be right back.	Elaine.yack	136
GUYBRUSH	34114	I was hoping I'd run into you again.	Elaine.yack	173
ELAINE	34115	I was hoping that too.	Elaine.yack	174
GUYBRUSH	34116	I got the note you left me.	Elaine.yack	175
ELAINE	34117	The what?	Elaine.yack	176
GUYBRUSH	34118	It said where you were working today?	Elaine.yack	177
ELAINE	34119	Oh that! I wasn't sure you were coming.	Elaine.yack	178
ELAINE	34120	But I'm glad you found me!	Elaine.yack	179
GUYBRUSH	34121	What's a nice girl like you doing in a tropical paradise like this?	Elaine.yack	180
ELAINE	34122	Harvesting limes for the foundation.	Elaine.yack	181
ELAINE	34123	And waiting for a ruggedly handsome pirate to stop by.	Elaine.yack	182
ELAINE	34124	What happened at the Voodoo Shop? Did you get The Secret?	Elaine.yack	184
GUYBRUSH	34125	Not yet, but I'm closer than ever.	Elaine.yack	186
GUYBRUSH	34126	I just have to gather a few Golden Keys together and I'm good to go.	Elaine.yack	187
ELAINE	34127	That sounds promising!	Elaine.yack	188
GUYBRUSH	34128	There was a complication.	Elaine.yack	189
ELAINE	34129	Isn't there always?	Elaine.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	34130	A big, heavy, rectangular complication, with five keyholes, and a Secret inside.	Elaine.yack	191
ELAINE	34131	Well that sounds daunting.	Elaine.yack	192		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	34132	Can we not talk about that right now?	Elaine.yack	193
ELAINE	34133	Of course, Plunder Bunny.	Elaine.yack	194
ELAINE	34134	What about LeChuck and Captain Madison?	Elaine.yack	197
GUYBRUSH	34135	They weren't there, oddly enough.	Elaine.yack	198
GUYBRUSH	34136	Somehow I still got there first.	Elaine.yack	199
GUYBRUSH	34137	But I think they're up to something. The safe has a weird glow that it didn't have before.	Elaine.yack	200
ELAINE	34138	Well... be careful.	Elaine.yack	201
ELAINE	34139	Guybrush...	Elaine.yack	206
GUYBRUSH	34140	Yes?	Elaine.yack	207
ELAINE	34141	Did you... did you maybe, take something? That you shouldn't have taken?	Elaine.yack	208
GUYBRUSH	34142	No.	Elaine.yack	209
GUYBRUSH	34143	Yes...	Elaine.yack	210
ELAINE	34144	Okay.	Elaine.yack	211
GUYBRUSH	34145	I don't know what you're talking about.	Elaine.yack	212
ELAINE	34146	I see.	Elaine.yack	214
ELAINE	34147	How was Brrr Muda?	Elaine.yack	219
GUYBRUSH	34148	Fine.	Elaine.yack	220
ELAINE	34149	Just thought I'd ask.	Elaine.yack	221
GUYBRUSH	34150	Cold.	Elaine.yack	222
ELAINE	34151	Not surprising.	Elaine.yack	223
GUYBRUSH	34152	I'm the queen there now!	Elaine.yack	224
ELAINE	34153	Yes. Word gets around about these things.	Elaine.yack	225
ELAINE	34154	How was Terror Island?	Elaine.yack	231
GUYBRUSH	34155	Fine.	Elaine.yack	232
ELAINE	34156	Just thought I'd ask.	Elaine.yack	233
GUYBRUSH	34157	Scary.	Elaine.yack	234
ELAINE	34158	The brochures do mention that.	Elaine.yack	235
GUYBRUSH	34159	How did you know I went there?	Elaine.yack	236
ELAINE	34160	You leave a bit of a trail sometimes.	Elaine.yack	237
ELAINE	34161	Did you happen to feel the earthquake while you were on Monkey Island?	Elaine.yack	244
GUYBRUSH	34162	No.	Elaine.yack	245
ELAINE	34163	Ah. Well, it was a big one.	Elaine.yack	246
GUYBRUSH	34164	A little.	Elaine.yack	247
ELAINE	34165	I thought you might have.	Elaine.yack	248
GUYBRUSH	34166	I think I was right at the epicenter!	Elaine.yack	249
ELAINE	34167	Yes, I think you were.	Elaine.yack	250
ELAINE	34168	You wouldn't happen to have a mop, would you?	Elaine.yack	256
GUYBRUSH	34169	No.	Elaine.yack	257
GUYBRUSH	34170	Not anymore.	Elaine.yack	258
ELAINE	34171	I see.	Elaine.yack	259
GUYBRUSH	34172	I made my own, but then I left it on LeChuck's ship.	Elaine.yack	260
GUYBRUSH	34173	It was awesome! I used a stuffed animal for the top part.	Elaine.yack	261
GUYBRUSH	34174	It was awesome! I used a shrunken head for the top part.	Elaine.yack	262
GUYBRUSH	34175	It was awesome! I used a sponge for the top part.	Elaine.yack	263
GUYBRUSH	34176	It was awesome! I used a clump of string for the top part.	Elaine.yack	264
ELAINE	34177	No problem. I don't actually need one, I was just curious.	Elaine.yack	266
GUYBRUSH	34178	Could you come to the ice quarry on Brrr Muda to talk with Stan about your pamphlet?	Elaine.yack	275
ELAINE	34179	Oh no, I couldn't possibly go there. Bad optics. He'll have to come here.	Elaine.yack	276
GUYBRUSH	34180	It's a prison, though. Him not leaving is sort of the main idea.	Elaine.yack	277
ELAINE	34181	How long 'til he's out?	Elaine.yack	278		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	34182	No idea.	Elaine.yack	279
GUYBRUSH	34183	A month.	Elaine.yack	280
GUYBRUSH	34184	Ten years.	Elaine.yack	281
ELAINE	34185	That's not so bad.	Elaine.yack	282
ELAINE	34186	Hm.	Elaine.yack	283
GUYBRUSH	34187	Are you sure you can't come talk to Stan at the ice quarry?	Elaine.yack	285
ELAINE	34188	Absolutely sure. He'll have to come here.	Elaine.yack	286
GUYBRUSH	34189	Okay.	Elaine.yack	287
GUYBRUSH	34190	How's your project going?	Elaine.yack	289
GUYBRUSH	34191	Can you spare any limes?	Elaine.yack	290
GUYBRUSH	34192	I haven't found you a good marketing expert yet.	Elaine.yack	291
ELAINE	34193	What about Stan Stanman, the used ship salesman?	Elaine.yack	294
ELAINE	34194	That guy could sell fleas to a dog, and probably would. Just what we need, actually.	Elaine.yack	295
GUYBRUSH	34195	Good thinking.	Elaine.yack	296
GUYBRUSH	34196	What do you think of Stan Stanman as a marketing advisor?	Elaine.yack	299
GUYBRUSH	34197	He's in jail, but maybe he can look at the pamphlet anyway?	Elaine.yack	302
ELAINE	34198	That guy could sell fleas to a dog, and probably would. Just what we need, actually.	Elaine.yack	303
ELAINE	34199	Good idea.	Elaine.yack	304
GUYBRUSH	34200	I'll go find a marketing expert now.	Elaine.yack	307
ELAINE	34201	I'll be right here when you get back.	Elaine.yack	308
GUYBRUSH	34202	I haven't showed your pamphlet to Stan yet.	Elaine.yack	310		DELETE
GUYBRUSH	34203	In fact I'm not even sure where he is these days.	Elaine.yack	313
ELAINE	34204	I heard a rumor he was in jail.	Elaine.yack	314
GUYBRUSH	34205	Oh, that figures.	Elaine.yack	315
GUYBRUSH	34206	I haven't shown your pamphlet to Stan yet.	Elaine.yack	318		UPDATE
ELAINE	34207	Okay.	Elaine.yack	319
GUYBRUSH	34208	I'll go find Stan now.	Elaine.yack	322
ELAINE	34209	Thanks.	Elaine.yack	323
GUYBRUSH	34210	How come the picture of us on your desk was torn in half?	Elaine.yack	325
GUYBRUSH	34211	You said a seagull carried away my half of the picture of us?	Elaine.yack	326
ELAINE	34212	It flew into the lime groves. So far I haven't found it. Sorry.	Elaine.yack	327
GUYBRUSH	34213	Love you.	Elaine.yack	329
ELAINE	34214	You too.	Elaine.yack	330
GUYBRUSH	34215	Love you.	Elaine.yack	333
ELAINE	34216	You too.	Elaine.yack	334
ELAINE	34217	Er, yes, sorry you saw that. There was an incident with a... seagull.	Elaine.yack	340		UPDATE
ELAINE	34218	It flew away with you into the lime groves. I looked but I couldn't find you!	Elaine.yack	341
GUYBRUSH	34219	I see.	Elaine.yack	342
ELAINE	34220	The project... has hit a snag.	Elaine.yack	351
ELAINE	34221	We have plenty of limes, as you can see. But people are refusing to take them.	Elaine.yack	352
ELAINE	34222	They say they don’t like the taste, and they don’t believe they'll help with scurvy.	Elaine.yack	353
ELAINE	34223	And they don’t want to sacrifice valuable cargo space that can be used for booty.	Elaine.yack	354
ELAINE	34224	As an elected official I could have issued an edict, but as a private citizen I have to convince people.	Elaine.yack	355
ELAINE	34225	I tried this flyer.	Elaine.yack	356
GUYBRUSH	34226	Yeah, I've read... part of this.	Elaine.yack	373
ELAINE	34227	I know, I know, it's terribly dry. But the facts are there!	Elaine.yack	374
GUYBRUSH	34228	Have you tried using a different font?	Elaine.yack	377
GUYBRUSH	34229	Comic Sans, for example?	Elaine.yack	378
ELAINE	34230	Yes, but I need a small one to fit all the information on.	Elaine.yack	379
GUYBRUSH	34231	What about adding bullet points? They could be little limes.	Elaine.yack	381
ELAINE	34232	People not liking limes is part of the problem, though.	Elaine.yack	382
GUYBRUSH	34233	Good point.	Elaine.yack	383
GUYBRUSH	34234	What if the text was centered instead of left-justified?	Elaine.yack	385
ELAINE	34235	Somehow I don't think that's going to make a lot of difference.	Elaine.yack	386
GUYBRUSH	34236	I'm not sure what to tell you.	Elaine.yack	388
ELAINE	34237	It's basically a sales and marketing problem, and neither of us is an expert in either of those things.	Elaine.yack	390
ELAINE	34239	Okay.	Elaine.yack	392
GUYBRUSH	34240	Can you spare any limes?	Elaine.yack	404
ELAINE	34241	You can take a few.	Elaine.yack	408
ELAINE	34242	Like I said, I'm having trouble giving them away.	Elaine.yack	418
ELAINE	34243	I'm having trouble giving them away, actually...	Elaine.yack	419
GUYBRUSH	40715	I see what you mean. I'll hang on to the flyer, maybe I can find a sales and marketing expert to look at it.	Elaine.yack	434

ELAINE	30468	{helpful_suggestion}Of course not, Carla, we'll need to generate public support. I'm working on that.	ElaineActivity.dinky	59
CARLA	30469	People around here don't like any kind of restrictions, even if it's for their own good.	ElaineActivity.dinky	61

GUYBRUSH	31348	This is the other half of that painting of me that I found lying around in the lime groves.	ElainesCamp.dinky	125
HOVER	10552	Take the painting	ElainesCamp.dinky	132
GUYBRUSH	31349	Wait a minute.. I'm pretty sure I sat for this portrait too.	ElainesCamp.dinky	136

GUYBRUSH	31350	Pirates used to have to steal this from Elaine, to prove themselves.	ElainesCamp.dinky	172
GUYBRUSH	31351	At least that's what they told me when they made me do it.	ElainesCamp.dinky	172
HOVER	10558	Check out that fantastic new pamphlet	ElainesCamp.dinky	180
GUYBRUSH	31352	It's a very convincing piece of marketing.	ElainesCamp.dinky	182
HOVER	10559	Take the new pamphlet	ElainesCamp.dinky	185
GUYBRUSH	31353	I'll just borrow this for a little while.	ElainesCamp.dinky	189
HOVER	10560	That staple remover brings back memories	ElainesCamp.dinky	200
GUYBRUSH	31354	I pinched a yak with it once. And then I sort of accidentally pinched the staple remover.	ElainesCamp.dinky	203
GUYBRUSH	31355	I had it for years before I remembered to give it back to Elaine.	ElainesCamp.dinky	203
GUYBRUSH	31356	She was happy and mad at the same time. Mappy.	ElainesCamp.dinky	203
GUYBRUSH	31357	(marked pickup for wording)Not everyone can list a staple remover among their cherished mementoes.	ElainesCamp.dinky	205

TEXT	20197	Scurvy, also known as scorbutus or hypoascorbemia, is a disease whose symptomology includes weakness, tiredness, and soreness in the extremities, progressing to bleeding of mucous membranes, gum disease, inability to heal, and, eventually, death.	ElainesScurvyFlyer.dinky	15
TEXT	20198	Scientific research suggests that scurvy may be the result of a deficiency of ascorbic acid, which plays a critical role in collagen synthesis.	ElainesScurvyFlyer.dinky	16
TEXT	20199	A recommended treatment is to supplement levels of this essential nutrient via the consumption of limes.	ElainesScurvyFlyer.dinky	17
TEXT	20200	Please take the recommended steps for your safety!	ElainesScurvyFlyer.dinky	18

GUYBRUSH	39289	I thought you liked silly endings?	Ending.yack	11
GUYBRUSH	39290	You and Chuckie play the ending of Monkey Island 2 really silly.	Ending.yack	12
BOYBRUSH	39291	That’s different. We’re kids and we’re just goofing around!	Ending.yack	13
BOYBRUSH	39292	You're the one who said you can't just change things.	Ending.yack	14
BOYBRUSH	39293	You said that's not how storytelling works!	Ending.yack	15
GUYBRUSH	39294	I did?	Ending.yack	16
BOYBRUSH	39295	I want to know the secret!	Ending.yack	17
BOYBRUSH	39296	You have to tell me what you really found in the chest!	Ending.yack	18
BOYBRUSH	39458	You have to tell me what it was!	Ending.yack	19
GUYBRUSH	39297	The chest was filled with gems, rubies and gold!	Ending.yack	21
GUYBRUSH	39459	A prize fit for a king! Or a mighty pirate!	Ending.yack	22
GUYBRUSH	39460	I buried it on a small island and made a really cool-looking map to where it is.	Ending.yack	23
BOYBRUSH	39298	I knew it! We’re rich! Rich rich rich!	Ending.yack	24
GUYBRUSH	39299	The secret was really the friends we made along the way.	Ending.yack	26

BOYBRUSH	39301	{cross}Mom! Dad won’t tell me what the secret is!	Ending.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	39302	Your mom was right, it was better not to know.	Ending.yack	31
GUYBRUSH	39462	What was exciting for me was imagining the possibilities, and talking about them with other people.	Ending.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	39463	All that would end if I peeked inside the chest. So I didn't.	Ending.yack	33
BOYBRUSH	39305	{cross}Mom! Dad won’t tell me what the secret is!	Ending.yack	34
GUYBRUSH	39464	Your mom was right, it's better not to know.	Ending.yack	36

GUYBRUSH	39309	I was telling him the one about how we found The Secret of Monkey Island.	Ending.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	40677	It changes with time and the person telling it.	Ending.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	40678	Everyone you ask will have a different idea.	Ending.yack	55
ELAINE	39310	(slight laugh)Ahaha, oh, that one!	Ending.yack	56		UPDATE
BOYBRUSH	40679	{cross}Mom! Dad won’t tell me what the secret is!	Ending.yack	56

FISHMONGER	37611	{arm_out}Welcome to the Cod's Wallop, Threepwood!	Fishers.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	37612	Thanks!	Fishers.yack	41
FISHER1	37613	We feature the “freshest” fish on the block, and the freshest company as well!	Fishers.yack	46
FISHMONGER	37614	Whether you're here to buy or just pass the time, we don't mind, though of course we do prefer it if you make a purchase.	Fishers.yack	47		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37615	I haven't forgotten about the discount you offered me.	Fishers.yack	51
FISHER1	37616	Er... yes...	Fishers.yack	52
FISHMONGER	37617	We've really got to stop doing that.	Fishers.yack	53
FISHER1	37618	I know, I know.	Fishers.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	37619	I'll definitely consider thinking about maybe buying something.	Fishers.yack	55
FISHMONGER	37620	Let us know when you've reached the point where you take the chain off your coinpurse.	Fishers.yack	56		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37621	Do you recommend anything in particular?	Fishers.yack	57
FISHMONGER	37622	The fish!	Fishers.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	37623	Did I hear you use quotation marks around the word “freshest”?	Fishers.yack	59
FISHER1	37624	“No.”	Fishers.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	37625	Didn't you guys used to be the pirate leaders? It's me, Guybrush Threepwood!	Fishers.yack	65
FISHER1	37626	Ah! I thought when we spotted him skulking around town that he looked passing familiar.	Fishers.yack	66
GUYBRUSH	37627	{fist_on_hips}I don't know that I'd call it “skulking.”	Fishers.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	37628	The shop seems nice.	Fishers.yack	69
FISHER1	37629	If by “nice” you mean, “a glorious cathedral to the fine art of fishing,” then I quite agree.	Fishers.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	37630	How come you retired from pirate leadering?	Fishers.yack	71
FISHMONGER	37631	Well now sometimes retirement is not so much a choice as a thing that settles upon ye.	Fishers.yack	72
FISHER1	37632	Like being becalmed at sea.	Fishers.yack	73
FISHMONGER	37633	But it's allowed us to open this place and pursue our passion for fishing, so, perhaps less like a calm, and more like a strong wind blowing in a particular direction.	Fishers.yack	74
FISHMONGER	37634	{arm_out}Have a look around, why don't ye?	Fishers.yack	76
FISHMONGER	37635	You did pass us by a number of times and never stopped to say hello.	Fishers.yack	80
FISHER1	37636	That'll be like skulking, without trying to hide it.	Fishers.yack	81
FISHMONGER	37637	Brazen skulking. Is there a word for that?	Fishers.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	37638	“Walking”?	Fishers.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	37639	“Not skulking”?	Fishers.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	37640	“Completely normal”?	Fishers.yack	85
FISHMONGER	37641	Aye, I remember ye now, Threepwood. Always were a bit of a smart aleck.	Fishers.yack	87
FISHER1	37642	But welcome to the shop just the same!	Fishers.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	37643	Can I join the Chums?	Fishers.yack	93

GUYBRUSH	37646	I'd like to buy some fish.	Fishers.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	37647	Can I trade in my fish for some other ones?	Fishers.yack	98
GUYBRUSH	37648	You guys fish, have you ever heard of someone called Bella Fisher?	Fishers.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	37649	What can you tell me about Bella Fisher?	Fishers.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	37650	Did Bella Fisher ever show you a big fancy key?	Fishers.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	37651	Tell me again about Bella Fisher's fishing spot.	Fishers.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	37652	I found Bella Fisher's fishing spot!	Fishers.yack	104
FISHER1	37653	Ha ha ha! Sure you did.	Fishers.yack	105
FISHMONGER	37654	If you're going to spin a yarn, try to put at least a little truth in it, lad.	Fishers.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	37655	But...	Fishers.yack	107
FISHMONGER	37656	Trust us on this.	Fishers.yack	108
GUYBRUSH	37657	Fine, never mind.	Fishers.yack	109
GUYBRUSH	37658	Remind me how I'm supposed to find other Chums?	Fishers.yack	111
FISHMONGER	37659	They'll have fishing lures just like yours.	Fishers.yack	112
FISHER1	37660	Possibly worn on their clothing.	Fishers.yack	113
FISHMONGER	37661	Or otherwise nearby.	Fishers.yack	114
FISHER1	37662	And then ye show them your own lure.	Fishers.yack	115		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37663	Got it.	Fishers.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	37664	How's it going, “chums”?	Fishers.yack	118
GUYBRUSH	37665	[silent]Hey, how about a burping contest!	Fishers.yack	119
GUYBRUSH	37666	Did you guys feel the earthquake?	Fishers.yack	120
FISHMONGER	37667	That we did!	Fishers.yack	121
FISHER1	37668	At first I thought it were just me stomach complaining about me breakfast.	Fishers.yack	122
FISHMONGER	37669	Aye, we all thought that.	Fishers.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	37670	{proud}I'm hunting for The Secret of Monkey Island!	Fishers.yack	125
FISHMONGER	37671	The Secret!	Fishers.yack	128
FISHER1	37672	What a prize!	Fishers.yack	129
GUYBRUSH	37673	{happy}I know!	Fishers.yack	130
FISHER1	37674	They say the pirate what holds The Secret can never be sunk, that the wind always fills his sails!	Fishers.yack	131
FISHMONGER	37675	In the old days we might've gone after it ourselves!	Fishers.yack	132
FISHER1	37676	But we've got new fish to fry, so to speak.	Fishers.yack	133
GUYBRUSH	37677	I think I'll browse today's catch!	Fishers.yack	135
FISHMONGER	37678	Ye'll find none better!	Fishers.yack	136
FISHER1	37679	Talk to the grisly gentleman at the counter about that, please.	Fishers.yack	142
FISHMONGER	37680	Yeah, it's my shift.	Fishers.yack	143
GUYBRUSH	37681	I'd like to buy some fish.	Fishers.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	37682	Can I trade in my fish for some other ones?	Fishers.yack	153
FISHMONGER	37683	That's an excellent life decision, me lad.	Fishers.yack	157
FISHMONGER	37684	Always happy to take a trade-in.	Fishers.yack	158
FISHMONGER	37685	{arm_out}Today we've got hagfish, toadfish, slimehead, bloater, and lumpsucker. What'll it be?	Fishers.yack	160
GUYBRUSH	39384	A new box of hagfish.	Fishers.yack	162
GUYBRUSH	37686	Hagfish.	Fishers.yack	165

GUYBRUSH	37689	Bloater.	Fishers.yack	183

GUYBRUSH	37690	Lumpsucker.	Fishers.yack	189
GUYBRUSH	37691	Never mind.	Fishers.yack	192
FISHMONGER	37692	Fine choice.	Fishers.yack	197
FISHMONGER	37693	Fresh off the boat.	Fishers.yack	203
FISHMONGER	37694	Stout fellow!	Fishers.yack	209
FISHMONGER	37695	An underrated delicacy.	Fishers.yack	215
FISHMONGER	37696	Cute little fellas, aren't they.	Fishers.yack	221
FISHMONGER	37697	Here's a boxful. Should be plenty.	Fishers.yack	247
FISHMONGER	37698	I'll just fill your box with new fish.	Fishers.yack	248
FISHMONGER	37699	Ye want me to run a tab for you?	Fishers.yack	281
GUYBRUSH	37700	Sure!	Fishers.yack	282
GUYBRUSH	37701	{point_up}And don't forget the discount.	Fishers.yack	283
FISHMONGER	37702	Aye... aye. First box'll be on the house, then.	Fishers.yack	284
FISHMONGER	37703	I'll put it on your tab.	Fishers.yack	286
GUYBRUSH	37704	Thanks.	Fishers.yack	288
GUYBRUSH	37705	It's a copy of “At the End of the Plank.”	Fishers.yack	312
FISHMONGER	37706	Oh aye. A gift from a good friend. I haven't actually read it myself yet.	Fishers.yack	313
GUYBRUSH	37707	Can I borrow this book?	Fishers.yack	323
FISHMONGER	37708	No, I haven't read it yet.	Fishers.yack	325
FISHER1	37709	Me either.	Fishers.yack	326
FISHER1	37710	Bella Fisher! Aye, she could spin a yarn from Port Royal to Trinidad. And back again!	Fishers.yack	334
FISHMONGER	37711	And a consummate angler, she was.	Fishers.yack	335
GUYBRUSH	37712	What?	Fishers.yack	336
FISHMONGER	37713	Good at fishing.	Fishers.yack	337
FISHER1	37714	She had a secret fishing spot, she did, more bounteous than the whole rest of the sea together.	Fishers.yack	338
FISHMONGER	37715	She probably rests there now, being as she did disappear on a fishing trip.	Fishers.yack	339
FISHER1	37716	No one knows the location, though tis rumored that she left clues as to its whereabouts.	Fishers.yack	340
FISHER1	37717	No one knows the location, though tis rumored that she left a clue as to its whereabouts.	Fishers.yack	341
FISHMONGER	37718	Not to my memory.	Fishers.yack	346
FISHER1	37719	No, I don't think so.	Fishers.yack	347
FISHER1	37720	No, I don't think so.	Fishers.yack	349
FISHMONGER	37721	Not to my memory.	Fishers.yack	350
GUYBRUSH	37722	Just thought I'd check.	Fishers.yack	352
FISHER1	37723	Three clues they say she left behind as to where it was, but no one knows what sort of clues they'd be.	Fishers.yack	356
FISHER1	37724	They say she left behind a clue as to where it was, but no one knows what sort of clue that'd be.	Fishers.yack	357
FISHMONGER	37725	All rumors, of course. Probably nothing to it.	Fishers.yack	358
GUYBRUSH	37726	What's that flag with all the holes in it?	Fishers.yack	370
FISHMONGER	37727	{arm_out}Quite proud of that. We caught it up in a fishing net one day, tis one of the signature flags of Bella Fisher herself!	Fishers.yack	372
GUYBRUSH	37728	Bella Fisher! That was Bella Fisher's flag?	Fishers.yack	373
FISHMONGER	37729	That's what I said, yes.	Fishers.yack	374
GUYBRUSH	37730	The name doesn't ring a bell.	Fishers.yack	375
FISHMONGER	37731	My sympathies, lad.	Fishers.yack	376
GUYBRUSH	37732	Is it all right if I take this flag with me?	Fishers.yack	384
FISHMONGER	37733	That would be within your rights as a well-respected Chum of the highest order.	Fishers.yack	386
GUYBRUSH	37734	Seriously?	Fishers.yack	396
TEXT	20482	Intermission	Fishers.yack	399
FISHMONGER	37735	Be sure to treat it nice. It doesn't need more holes than it's got already.	Fishers.yack	409
GUYBRUSH	37736	Is the flag for sale?	Fishers.yack	423
FISHER1	37737	Bite yer tongue! That's property of the Chums!	Fishers.yack	424
FISHER2	37738	Shh!	Fishers.yack	429
GUYBRUSH	37739	The who?	Fishers.yack	430
FISHER1	37740	No one!	Fishers.yack	431
FISHMONGER	37741	It's too late, the bait's out of the bag, we might as well tell him.	Fishers.yack	432
GUYBRUSH	37742	Yeah! Tell me!	Fishers.yack	433
FISHMONGER	37743	The Chums is by way of being a semi-secret society of anglers.	Fishers.yack	434
FISHMONGER	37744	Indeed a bit more “semi” than we were just a minute ago.	Fishers.yack	435		UPDATE
FISHER1	37745	Sorry.	Fishers.yack	436
GUYBRUSH	37746	Anglers?	Fishers.yack	437
FISHMONGER	37747	That means people who fish.	Fishers.yack	438
FISHER1	37748	Mostly we tell stories!	Fishers.yack	439
FISHMONGER	37749	Aye. Stories about fish.	Fishers.yack	440
GUYBRUSH	37750	Can Chum members use the flag, for, um... events and things like that?	Fishers.yack	446
FISHMONGER	37751	The most respected members can.	Fishers.yack	447
FISHMONGER	37752	Once you show us you can tell an excellent story, we'll consider loaning you the flag.	Fishers.yack	448
GUYBRUSH	37753	Why are there so many holes in the flag?	Fishers.yack	454
FISHMONGER	37754	My guess would be grapeshot or some such.	Fishers.yack	455
FISHER1	37755	I never heard Bella tell no stories about it, though.	Fishers.yack	456
FISHMONGER	37756	Nor I. Which, truth be told, is not like her at all.	Fishers.yack	457
GUYBRUSH	37757	When can I use Bella's flag?	Fishers.yack	462
FISHMONGER	37758	When you've learnt all you can about the telling of tales, and you've come back and told us a good one.	Fishers.yack	463
FISHMONGER	37759	When you've told us an excellent tale, and not before.	Fishers.yack	464
GUYBRUSH	37760	Any chance I could borrow the flag?	Fishers.yack	468
FISHMONGER	37761	Not being a member of the Chums, no, no chance at all.	Fishers.yack	469
FISHMONGER	37762	Yes, yes, that's very clever.	Fishers.yack	475
GUYBRUSH	37763	Do we have any special privileges for being high-ranking Chums?	Fishers.yack	476
FISHMONGER	37764	Not even the respect of your peers, my boy.	Fishers.yack	477
FISHMONGER	37765	Just the use of any property that belongs to the society.	Fishers.yack	478
GUYBRUSH	37766	Aha!	Fishers.yack	479
FISHMONGER	37767	Keep yer voice down, Guybrush. Remember the society is semi-secret.	Fishers.yack	484
GUYBRUSH	37768	Emphasis on the “semi.”	Fishers.yack	485
FISHMONGER	37769	But that's not on purpose!	Fishers.yack	486
FISHMONGER	37770	You have the confident look of a man with a story in his belly, just squirming to get out. But...	Fishers.yack	491
FISHMONGER	37771	I feel as though I should warn you that, this being the more casual mode of the game, participation in the Chums is strictly for fun.	Fishers.yack	504
FISHMONGER	37772	There'll be no reward whatsoever for doing it successfully.	Fishers.yack	505
GUYBRUSH	37773	Totally useless activity, got it. Can I join anyway?	Fishers.yack	506
FISHMONGER	37774	Weeeellllll...	Fishers.yack	508
GUYBRUSH	37775	{wistful}Please?	Fishers.yack	510
GUYBRUSH	37776	{proud}I can tell a good story.	Fishers.yack	511
GUYBRUSH	37777	{point_up}I promise to keep it semi-secret!	Fishers.yack	512
FISHMONGER	37778	Have you got any good fish stories?	Fishers.yack	514
GUYBRUSH	37779	Yeah! One time I was swallowed by a manatee!	Fishers.yack	515
FISHMONGER	37780	Aye, stop right there, ah, let me give you some advice: make the story about a whale instead.	Fishers.yack	516		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37781	But it wasn't a whale. It was a manatee.	Fishers.yack	517
FISHMONGER	37782	No one knows what a manatee is. Trust me, make it a whale, it'll be better.	Fishers.yack	518
GUYBRUSH	37783	Okay.	Fishers.yack	519
FISHMONGER	37784	Now, because I like your enthusiasm, and for no other reason, I'm going to induct you into the Chums.	Fishers.yack	520
GUYBRUSH	37785	{fist_pump}(celebratory)Yes!	Fishers.yack	521
FISHMONGER	37786	Take this fishing lure.	Fishers.yack	522
FISHMONGER	37787	Other Chums will have these too, on their clothes, or displayed somewhere.	Fishers.yack	531
FISHMONGER	37788	Go out and find them, show them your lure, and tell them your story. They'll give you advice.	Fishers.yack	532
GUYBRUSH	37789	I'm great at taking advice!	Fishers.yack	533
FISHMONGER	37790	Learn all you can, then come back here and tell us your story again.	Fishers.yack	534
GUYBRUSH	37791	Where can I find Chums who aren't you guys?	Fishers.yack	535
FISHER1	37792	You could start with that young pirate that hangs around at the Scumm Bar...	Fishers.yack	536
FISHMONGER	37793	Don't tell him where to start, he's supposed to look for the lures!	Fishers.yack	537
FISHER1	37794	Sorry.	Fishers.yack	538
FISHMONGER	37795	You really should show us the lure for official Chums business.	Fishers.yack	544
FISHMONGER	37796	We like ritual in the Chums, it's part of the fun!	Fishers.yack	545
GUYBRUSH	37797	Are the blowfish for sale?	Fishers.yack	559
FISHER1	37798	No indeed! These are for personal use.	Fishers.yack	561
FISHER1	37799	They're excellent for burping contests. Care to join us?	Fishers.yack	562
GUYBRUSH	37800	Don't mind if I do!	Fishers.yack	563
FISHER1	37801	Winner gets to keep the blowfish!	Fishers.yack	565
GUYBRUSH	37802	Hey, how about a burping contest!	Fishers.yack	579
FISHER1	37803	Hoho! Always!	Fishers.yack	581		UPDATE

ELAINE	30557	Well... we did what we could with the materials at hand.	Fixing.dinky	66
GUYBRUSH	30558	I love it. It oozes nostalgia!	Fixing.dinky	69
ELAINE	30559	Among other things. You steer, I'll bail.	Fixing.dinky	73
GUYBRUSH	30560	Huh... I would expect Madison or LeChuck's ship to be here by now.	Fixing.dinky	134
ELAINE	30561	{suspicious}Oh my goodness, look at the damage!	Fixing.dinky	136		UPDATE
ELAINE	30562	I've got to go and talk to Carla about organizing earthquake relief.	Fixing.dinky	144
GUYBRUSH	30563	You're not coming to the Voodoo Shop?	Fixing.dinky	146
ELAINE	38569	Of course I want to!	Fixing.dinky	148
ELAINE	38570	But this is a crisis. There'll be other damage. I have to help.	Fixing.dinky	150
ELAINE	38571	I'll want to hear all about it later!	Fixing.dinky	152
GUYBRUSH	30566	Right. See you soon!	Fixing.dinky	157
GUYBRUSH	35476	I'm working on a way for us to get to Monkey Island without using a voodoo potion.	Flair.yack	19
FLAIRGOREY	35477	(doesn't care)Glad to hear it.	Flair.yack	20
FLAIRGOREY	35478	I'm working on something else. Great meeting, see you later.	Flair.yack	21
GUYBRUSH	35479	(excited)I've got an idea for how we can get to Monkey Island after all!	Flair.yack	25
FLAIRGOREY	35480	Does Iron Rose know you're working on that instead of swabbing things that need swabbing?	Flair.yack	26
GUYBRUSH	35481	(excited)Not yet, but I'm on my way to tell her!	Flair.yack	27
GUYBRUSH	35482	Flair?	Flair.yack	34
FLAIRGOREY	35483	(response to unwelcome interruption)-sigh- What is it?	Flair.yack	35
FLAIRGOREY	35484	(response to unwelcome interruption)What?	Flair.yack	35
FLAIRGOREY	35485	(response to unwelcome interruption)Yes?	Flair.yack	35
FLAIRGOREY	35486	(response to unwelcome interruption)What do you want?	Flair.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	39139	I'd like to call in that favor you owe me.	Flair.yack	39
GUYBRUSH	35487	Can we talk about your vote on going to Monkey Island?	Flair.yack	40
GUYBRUSH	35488	[silent]What exactly is your job on this ship?	Flair.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	35489	Forgive me, but, I'm unclear- what exactly is your job on this ship?	Flair.yack	42
FLAIRGOREY	35490	I'm the second mate, bosun, gunner, ship's surgeon, and composer. And I do the laundry.	Flair.yack	43
GUYBRUSH	35491	{question}Wow! Save a little for the rest of us, huh?	Flair.yack	44
FLAIRGOREY	35492	You after my jobs? Better not be.	Flair.yack	45
FLAIRGOREY	35493	I need the cash. I'm saving up.	Flair.yack	46
GUYBRUSH	35494	What are you saving up for?	Flair.yack	48
FLAIRGOREY	35495	None of your business, swabbie.	Flair.yack	49
GUYBRUSH	35496	I want to check in on your vote about going to Monkey Island.	Flair.yack	51
GUYBRUSH	35497	How come you stabbed Gullet?	Flair.yack	52
FLAIRGOREY	35498	(a threat)He asked too many questions.	Flair.yack	53
GUYBRUSH	35499	{whoa}How many questions did he ask?	Flair.yack	54
FLAIRGOREY	35500	(a threat)One.	Flair.yack	55
GUYBRUSH	35501	{point}What's that you're working on?	Flair.yack	57
FLAIRGOREY	35502	(actually interested to talk about this)It's theme music for LeChuck, I'm sketching out a melody.	Flair.yack	59
FLAIRGOREY	35503	(actually interested to talk about this)I'm happy with the first two notes. They're both “do.”	Flair.yack	60
FLAIRGOREY	35504	(actually interested to talk about this)The repetition emphasizes LeChuck's relentless nature, his dogged pursuit of his goals. It's a quality I admire.	Flair.yack	61
FLAIRGOREY	35505	(actually interested to talk about this)Still working on the other notes. My target is seven total.	Flair.yack	62
FLAIRGOREY	35506	(actually interested to talk about this)I'm hoping to work in an augmented fourth, to make it sound demonic.	Flair.yack	63
GUYBRUSH	35507	{winkwink}(lying)Right, right. I understand completely.	Flair.yack	64
FLAIRGOREY	35508	You must have some scrubbing to get to, right, swabbie?	Flair.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	35509	How's the score going?	Flair.yack	67
FLAIRGOREY	35510	It would be going a lot better with fewer interruptions.	Flair.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	35511	I'll leave you alone now.	Flair.yack	70
FLAIRGOREY	35512	Yes you will.	Flair.yack	71
FLAIRGOREY	35513	Relax, I'll vote with you, I owe you one. Go swab a deck or something.	Flair.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	35514	(cheerful)Will do.	Flair.yack	78
FLAIRGOREY	35515	I told you, swabbie, bring me my grandmother's whale knife and my vote's all yours.	Flair.yack	83
FLAIRGOREY	35516	(ha ha you're screwed)Hahaha hahahaha!	Flair.yack	84		UPDATE
FLAIRGOREY	35517	Now go away.	Flair.yack	85
FLAIRGOREY	35518	(dismisal)No.	Flair.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	35519	{shrug}Aw c'mon. There must be something I can do for you. Something you want.	Flair.yack	92
FLAIRGOREY	35520	Nothing you can give me.	Flair.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	35521	Try me.	Flair.yack	94
FLAIRGOREY	35522	Okay, fine.	Flair.yack	95
FLAIRGOREY	35523	Earlier today I lost my grandmother's whale knife.	Flair.yack	96
FLAIRGOREY	35524	It was a gorgeous heirloom. I treasured it. And now it's gone.	Flair.yack	97
FLAIRGOREY	35525	Bring me the knife and I'll vote for your stupid plan.	Flair.yack	98
GUYBRUSH	35526	{point_up}Great! Can you tell me where and when you last saw it?	Flair.yack	99
FLAIRGOREY	35527	It was sticking out of Gullet's back, right after I stabbed him with it.	Flair.yack	100
FLAIRGOREY	35528	Probably still there.	Flair.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	35529	(but...)LeChuck threw Gullet over the side.	Flair.yack	103
FLAIRGOREY	35530	Yep! Joke's on you, swabbie!	Flair.yack	104
FLAIRGOREY	35531	(mean)Ha ha ha ha!	Flair.yack	105		UPDATE
FLAIRGOREY	35532	And I guess on me too. Now beat it, I'm busy.	Flair.yack	106		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	35533	I have your knife.	Flair.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	35534	(I know all I need to)Okay.	Flair.yack	113
FLAIRGOREY	39140	Favor?	Flair.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	39141	Remember I brought you your knife? I was surprised when you didn't vote with me on going to Monkey Island.	Flair.yack	117
FLAIRGOREY	39142	Ugh. Fine. I hate logic. And favors.	Flair.yack	118
FLAIRGOREY	39143	But, I will vote for your stupid plan.	Flair.yack	119
GUYBRUSH	39144	Fantastic!	Flair.yack	120
FLAIRGOREY	39145	Now beat it, I'm busy.	Flair.yack	121
FLAIRGOREY	35535	(you've got some nerve)You!	Flair.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	35536	{question}(caught)Uh, hi.	Flair.yack	140
FLAIRGOREY	35537	You're not welcome on this ship, Threepwood.	Flair.yack	141
FLAIRGOREY	35538	(you again)Threepwood!	Flair.yack	143
FLAIRGOREY	35539	Not so sneaky without your magic disguise, are you?	Flair.yack	144
GUYBRUSH	40154	(shoved overboard)Grunt	Flair.yack	150
GUYBRUSH	40155	(shoved overboard)Grunt	Flair.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	40156	(shoved overboard)Grunt	Flair.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	40157	(shoved overboard)Grunt into yelp	Flair.yack	153
GUYBRUSH	40158	(shoved overboard)Grunt into yelp	Flair.yack	154
GUYBRUSH	40159	(shoved overboard)Grunt into yelp	Flair.yack	155
GUYBRUSH	35540	Hm. I wonder if my current “partners” will have any ideas for what to do about this.	Flair.yack	168
GUYBRUSH	35541	Permission to come aboard?	Flair.yack	176
FLAIRGOREY	35542	(we're not friends)Gullet! I thought we'd lost you.	Flair.yack	177
GUYBRUSH	35543	{fists_on_hips}Sorry to disappoint you.	Flair.yack	179
FLAIRGOREY	35544	Am I that obvious? Note to self, practice people skills.	Flair.yack	180
GUYBRUSH	35545	I'm still feeling the sting of your knife.	Flair.yack	182
FLAIRGOREY	35546	I've got the knife back, so, you let me know if the feeling fades.	Flair.yack	183
GUYBRUSH	35547	{fists_on_hips}It'll take more than a bath to get rid of old Gullet.	Flair.yack	185
FLAIRGOREY	35548	Worth a try on several levels, though.	Flair.yack	186
FLAIRGOREY	39146	(suddenly thinking of it, suspicious)Your voice sounds funny.	Flair.yack	191
GUYBRUSH	39147	{shrug}Uh, yeah, -ahem- still a few quarts of seawater in the lungs I guess.	Flair.yack	192
FLAIRGOREY	39148	(suspicious)I guess...	Flair.yack	193
FLAIRGOREY	35549	Anyway, “welcome” back to the ship.	Flair.yack	194
FLAIRGOREY	35550	Do me a favor and guard this spot until LeChuck and Iron Rose get back.	Flair.yack	195
FLAIRGOREY	35551	I finally finished the piece I was working on, and I want to block out ten minutes for celebrating on a beach where none of you can find me.	Flair.yack	196
FLAIRGOREY	35552	I've almost finished the piece I was working on, and I want to get back to it.	Flair.yack	197
GUYBRUSH	35553	I promise I'll give it my utmost attention. I won't let you down.	Flair.yack	199
GUYBRUSH	35554	(why are you looking at me like that)What?	Flair.yack	209
FLAIRGOREY	35555	Nothing. You just seem different.	Flair.yack	214
FLAIRGOREY	35556	Don't let anybody on board or I'll stab you again.	Flair.yack	215
GUYBRUSH	35557	It's me, Gullet. Why would you trust me with that?	Flair.yack	216
FLAIRGOREY	35558	Because you know if you screw it up I'll stab you again.	Flair.yack	217
GUYBRUSH	35559	{point}What are you working on?	Flair.yack	232
FLAIRGOREY	35560	It's the score for LeChuck's theme. Nothing you'd be interested in. Get back to your post.	Flair.yack	233
GUYBRUSH	35561	{point}How's the score coming along?	Flair.yack	238
FLAIRGOREY	35562	The music's done, I'm just decorating it now. Go back and guard the ship like I told you.	Flair.yack	239
GUYBRUSH	35902	{point_up}Shouldn't you be up in the crow's nest, doing lookout stuff?	Flambe.yack	28
FLAMBE	35903	The best show is down here. I want to see if you screw up this thing with the skull.	Flambe.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	39241	{point_up}Can I check the crow's nest for a skull?	Flambe.yack	31
FLAMBE	39242	There's nothing you need up there.	Flambe.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	39243	Any ideas for where to find a skull?	Flambe.yack	34
FLAMBE	39244	I'm really more of a watcher than a helper.	Flambe.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	39245	What's it like working for LeChuck?	Flambe.yack	37
FLAMBE	39246	I can't complain.	Flambe.yack	38
GUYBRUSH	39247	Really?	Flambe.yack	39
FLAMBE	39248	It's in the employee handbook. No complaining.	Flambe.yack	40
FLAMBE	39249	You'll live longer if you remember that, new guy.	Flambe.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	39250	Do we have a union?	Flambe.yack	43
FLAMBE	39251	YOU sure don't, swabbie.	Flambe.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	39252	Gotta go, I've got a job to do!	Flambe.yack	46
FLAMBE	39253	My condolences.	Flambe.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	35906	Nice view up here.	Flambe.yack	53
FLAMBE	35907	(if you like that sort of thing)Sure.	Flambe.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	35908	I'm just looking around for another way to get to Monkey Island.	Flambe.yack	55
FLAMBE	35909	Be my guest.	Flambe.yack	56
GUYBRUSH	35910	I've got an idea for how we can get to Monkey Island!	Flambe.yack	60
FLAMBE	35911	(doesn't care)So you said. You should tell Iron Rose about it.	Flambe.yack	61
FLAMBE	35912	Or someone who cares, if you can find such a person.	Flambe.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	35913	Working hard?	Flambe.yack	71
FLAMBE	35914	(self-satisfied)Never.	Flambe.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	35915	Let's talk about your vote on going to Monkey Island.	Flambe.yack	76
GUYBRUSH	35916	About your vote...	Flambe.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	35917	Do you have a favorite food?	Flambe.yack	78
FLAMBE	35918	Ah, yes. Scorched Alaska!	Flambe.yack	80
FLAMBE	35919	Salty like widow's tears, sweet like revenge.	Flambe.yack	81
FLAMBE	35920	And fiery, like a hot poker to the tongue!	Flambe.yack	82
FLAMBE	35921	Except when Putra makes it, unfortunately. She does not make it hot enough for my taste.	Flambe.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	35922	Sounds... good?	Flambe.yack	84
FLAMBE	35923	Exquisitely painful, yes.	Flambe.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	35924	Tell me again about Scorched Alaska?	Flambe.yack	87
FLAMBE	35925	Prepared correctly, it should be like a hot poker to the tongue.	Flambe.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	35926	How do you make Scorched Alaska?	Flambe.yack	90
FLAMBE	35927	I don't. I have someone else make it.	Flambe.yack	91
FLAMBE	35928	A professional, if possible. There are safety concerns.	Flambe.yack	92
GUYBRUSH	35937	{point}What's the book?	Flambe.yack	94
GUYBRUSH	35938	Underworld jokes, you say. Any good?	Flambe.yack	95
GUYBRUSH	35939	Would you describe that book as “entertaining”?	Flambe.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	35940	{point}Think you'll be done reading soon?	Flambe.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	35941	Does it hurt to have your head on fire?	Flambe.yack	98
FLAMBE	35942	I'm a demon, we're sort of all about that. You get used to it.	Flambe.yack	99
GUYBRUSH	35943	If you stuck your head in a bucket of water, would it help?	Flambe.yack	101
FLAMBE	35944	Demon fire burns underwater, so, no.	Flambe.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	35945	I'm guessing you don't wear hats?	Flambe.yack	105
FLAMBE	35946	Once in a while. I look good in them for a few seconds.	Flambe.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	35947	I can't stop thinking about your head.	Flambe.yack	108
GUYBRUSH	35948	I mean, what it would be like to have a head that was on fire.	Flambe.yack	109
FLAMBE	35949	(casual)I can help you out with that if you're really curious.	Flambe.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	35952	Remind me how you make Scorched Alaska?	Flambe.yack	112
FLAMBE	35953	I engage a professional.	Flambe.yack	113
GUYBRUSH	35954	Keep up the bad work.	Flambe.yack	115
FLAMBE	35955	(self-satisfied)Always.	Flambe.yack	116
FLAMBE	35956	Relax, I'll back your play.	Flambe.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	35957	Are there any particular favors I can do for you?	Flambe.yack	129
GUYBRUSH	35958	{question}I don't know a lot about your interests.	Flambe.yack	130
FLAMBE	35959	My main interests are sleeping and eating. I try to do both as much as possible.	Flambe.yack	131
FLAMBE	35960	It doesn't mean much to me one way or the other. But hey, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.	Flambe.yack	136
GUYBRUSH	35961	You want me to scratch your back?	Flambe.yack	137
FLAMBE	35962	Figure of speech. No need to burn yourself.	Flambe.yack	138
FLAMBE	35963	Do something nice for me and maybe I help you.	Flambe.yack	141
GUYBRUSH	35964	Maybe I will.	Flambe.yack	146
GUYBRUSH	35965	I happen to have a Scorched Alaska right here...	Flambe.yack	147
GUYBRUSH	35966	Is this how it looks when you're ready to make sail?	Flambe.yack	155
FLAMBE	35967	Pretty much.	Flambe.yack	156
GUYBRUSH	35968	Fair enough.	Flambe.yack	157
GUYBRUSH	35969	What are you reading?	Flambe.yack	170
GUYBRUSH	35970	What's the book?	Flambe.yack	171
FLAMBE	35971	It's a book of underworld jokes. Jokes from beyond the pale, unheard of in this world.	Flambe.yack	174
GUYBRUSH	35972	(referring to a book)Any good?	Flambe.yack	179
FLAMBE	35973	(truthful but relaxed about it)Hilarious.	Flambe.yack	182
GUYBRUSH	35974	Would you describe this book as “entertaining”?	Flambe.yack	187
FLAMBE	35975	I would use a shorter word, but, yes.	Flambe.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	35976	{point}Think you'll be done reading soon?	Flambe.yack	195

GUYBRUSH	35446	Flambe! You're awake!	FlambeGuard.yack	22
FLAMBE	40599	Not for long. I'm just here to tell you that you're making a mistake.	FlambeGuard.yack	26
FLAMBE	40600	LeChuck's obsession consumes him like a frog swallowing a tarantula.	FlambeGuard.yack	27
FLAMBE	40601	You don't want to be there when he opens that chest.	FlambeGuard.yack	28
GUYBRUSH	40602	Correct. I want to be there BEFORE he opens it.	FlambeGuard.yack	30
FLAMBE	40603	You two deserve each other.	FlambeGuard.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	40604	Are you just trying to slow me down?	FlambeGuard.yack	33
FLAMBE	40605	LeChuck doesn't handle frustration well.	FlambeGuard.yack	34
FLAMBE	40606	You've been warned.	FlambeGuard.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	35456	Let me pass or I run you through with my sword.	FlambeGuard.yack	38
GUYBRUSH	35467	I will lance your spleen like a boil and your boils like a spleen!	FlambeGuard.yack	53
FLAMBE	35474	Fighting is a lot of work and it's not in my contract.	FlambeGuard.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	35475	Yeah, that's right! Run!	FlambeGuard.yack	72

HOVER	11002	Smell the ingredients	Galley.dinky	578
HOVER	11003	Pungent odor	Galley.dinky	578
GUYBRUSH	31875	Yuck.	Galley.dinky	581
GUYBRUSH	31876	At first I thought the privy must be behind there, but no, it's just the pantry.	Galley.dinky	583
HOVER	11004	Ask what's in the pantry	Galley.dinky	588
GUYBRUSH	31877	What is all this stuff, anyway?	Galley.dinky	592
PUTRA	31878	Oh, you know, urchin husks, bile duct extract, sugar, fangweed... nothing unusual.	Galley.dinky	594		UPDATE
HOVER	11005	Admire the flowers	Galley.dinky	603
GUYBRUSH	31879	The daisies really brighten up the place.	Galley.dinky	605
PUTRA	31880	What's up with you, Gullet? It's like you're a different person.	Galley.dinky	611
PUTRA	31881	It's creepy.	Galley.dinky	611
PUTRA	31882	They really do.	Galley.dinky	613
HOVER	11006	Nasty implements	Galley.dinky	626
GUYBRUSH	31883	It's hard to tell if those are for cooking or combat.	Galley.dinky	628
PUTRA	31884	It's cute that you think there's a difference.	Galley.dinky	633
HOVER	11007	Consider the cupboard	Galley.dinky	646
GUYBRUSH	31885	That's held shut with a pretty sturdy piece of timber.	Galley.dinky	646
HOVER	11008	Reflect on the piece of wood	Galley.dinky	647
GUYBRUSH	31886	It won't keep anyone out, but it could keep something in.	Galley.dinky	647
HOVER	11009	Ponder the security measures	Galley.dinky	648
GUYBRUSH	31887	There must be something fairly nasty in there.	Galley.dinky	648
HOVER	11010	Wonder what's inside	Galley.dinky	649
GUYBRUSH	31888	What could it be? Panther? Python? Undead creepy-crawly monster?	Galley.dinky	649
HOVER	11011	I'd better not open this	Galley.dinky	650
GUYBRUSH	31889	I could get mauled or something.	Galley.dinky	650
HOVER	11012	Plain old empty cupboard	Galley.dinky	653
GUYBRUSH	31890	Somehow I wish I'd never asked. It was more exciting before.	Galley.dinky	664
HOVER	11013	Ask what's in the cupboard	Galley.dinky	669
GUYBRUSH	31891	Hey Putra, what horrible creature are you keeping in here that you have to bar it shut?	Galley.dinky	675
PUTRA	31892	What? The cupboard's empty. The board's just there to keep it from flying open in heavy seas.	Galley.dinky	677
GUYBRUSH	31893	Oh.	Galley.dinky	679
PUTRA	31894	You'd think you'd never been in a galley before.	Galley.dinky	681
GUYBRUSH	36740	Dear Elaine,	GreetingCard.yack	48
GUYBRUSH	36741	Dear Wally,	GreetingCard.yack	50
GUYBRUSH	36742	Dear Carla,	GreetingCard.yack	52
GUYBRUSH	36743	To Whom It May Concern,	GreetingCard.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	36744	Sorry for blowing you up that one time.	GreetingCard.yack	63
GUYBRUSH	36745	Sorry for forgetting your birthday.	GreetingCard.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	36746	Sorry for forgetting our anniversary.	GreetingCard.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	36747	Sorry for losing the book I borrowed.	GreetingCard.yack	69
GUYBRUSH	36748	I realize that you are tough on toughness...	GreetingCard.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	36749	I admire that you are hard on softness...	GreetingCard.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	36750	I value that you are dedicated to dedication...	GreetingCard.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	36751	I appreciate that you are keen on bluntness...	GreetingCard.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	36752	Your generosity is an inspiration to me...	GreetingCard.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	36753	Your capacity for forgiveness is well known to me...	GreetingCard.yack	89
GUYBRUSH	36754	Your understanding and compassion astonish me...	GreetingCard.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	36755	...as shown by your actions at Santo Domingo.	GreetingCard.yack	98
GUYBRUSH	36756	...as shown by your actions at Santa Catalina.	GreetingCard.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	36757	...as shown by your actions at Port Elizabeth.	GreetingCard.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	36758	...as shown by your actions at Porto Bello.	GreetingCard.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	36759	...and everybody says how nice you are.	GreetingCard.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	36760	...and I always tell people how nice you are.	GreetingCard.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	36761	...and I know you're really nicer than people say you are.	GreetingCard.yack	108
GUYBRUSH	36762	Please accept my humblest apology.	GreetingCard.yack	115
GUYBRUSH	36763	Even though it wasn't really my fault.	GreetingCard.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	36764	I promise to do better in the future.	GreetingCard.yack	125
GUYBRUSH	36765	I've implemented a reminder system for myself.	GreetingCard.yack	126
GUYBRUSH	36766	You scare the heck out of me.	GreetingCard.yack	127
GUYBRUSH	36767	Warmly, Guybrush.	GreetingCard.yack	137
GUYBRUSH	36768	Sincerely, Guybrush.	GreetingCard.yack	138
GUYBRUSH	36769	Love, Guybrush.	GreetingCard.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	36770	With fear and respect, Guybrush.	GreetingCard.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	36771	This is for you.	GreetingCard.yack	169
CARLA	36772	You're giving me a frog?	GreetingCard.yack	171
GUYBRUSH	36773	It's a forgiveness frog. For when words aren't enough.	GreetingCard.yack	176
CARLA	36774	You haven't even bothered to write anything personal on this frog! That's just rude.	GreetingCard.yack	183
CARLA	36775	This frog isn't even addressed to me! I don't know what you think you're doing.	GreetingCard.yack	188
CARLA	36776	(reading to herself)“Dear Carla, mm nm hm hum hm...”	GreetingCard.yack	192
CARLA	36777	What's this about blowing me up? I don't remember it quite like that.	GreetingCard.yack	195
CARLA	36778	Anyway, I don't know why you're apologizing, and I'm not sure YOU know either.	GreetingCard.yack	196
CARLA	36779	What's this about forgetting my birthday? I'm pretty sure I never told you my birthday.	GreetingCard.yack	200
CARLA	36780	Not the real one, anyway.	GreetingCard.yack	201
CARLA	36781	Forgot our anniversary? Anniversary of what?	GreetingCard.yack	205
CARLA	36782	I think you're starting to lose it, Guybrush.	GreetingCard.yack	206
CARLA	36783	Not really your fault?!	GreetingCard.yack	212
CARLA	36784	This isn't an apology, it's an excuse!	GreetingCard.yack	213
CARLA	36785	This is a nice sentiment, but it's very impersonal.	GreetingCard.yack	218
CARLA	36786	It's like you don't know a single fact about me.	GreetingCard.yack	219
CARLA	36787	This is a nice sentiment, and it looks like you even know something about me.	GreetingCard.yack	223
CARLA	36788	ONE thing. You can do better.	GreetingCard.yack	224
CARLA	36789	This is a nice sentiment.	GreetingCard.yack	228
CARLA	36790	But the only personal thing you got right in here is my name.	GreetingCard.yack	229
CARLA	36791	Ugh. It looks like you tried to include personal details, but then you got them wrong!	GreetingCard.yack	233
CARLA	36792	You don't know me at all.	GreetingCard.yack	234
CARLA	36793	I'm impressed, Guybrush. Surprisingly thoughtful, considering it's you.	GreetingCard.yack	238
CARLA	36794	I'm strangely moved to forgive you for losing my book.	GreetingCard.yack	239
CARLA	36795	And I'll treasure this frog as a memento of the time you did something right.	GreetingCard.yack	240
CARLA	36796	I reject your frog.	GreetingCard.yack	247

GUYBRUSH	37914	I have to say I thought you were gone for good.	Gullet.yack	33
GUYBRUSH	37915	I was feeling no small amount of pleasure about it, in fact.	Gullet.yack	34
GULLET	37916	It'll take more than a bath to get rid of old Gullet!	Gullet.yack	35
GULLET	37917	Now, pull me out of here before I hang you by your own intestines, swabbie!	Gullet.yack	36
GUYBRUSH	37918	It's actually first swab, now.	Gullet.yack	39
GULLET	37919	What is?	Gullet.yack	40
GUYBRUSH	37920	Me. LeChuck gave me your job.	Gullet.yack	41
GULLET	37921	You?! Not likely!	Gullet.yack	42
GUYBRUSH	37922	I do prefer a management role. Less scrounging, more lounging.	Gullet.yack	43
GULLET	37923	I'm going to give your pancreas to my rat for a pillow!	Gullet.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	37924	You might want to take a friendlier tone.	Gullet.yack	46
GULLET	37925	This is my friendly tone, you blabbering pile of excrement!	Gullet.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	37926	[silent]I can hold my breath for ten minutes. How about you?	Gullet.yack	49
GUYBRUSH	37927	I can hold my breath for ten minutes, more or less. How about you?	Gullet.yack	50
GULLET	37928	Well, technically, I don't have to breathe at all.	Gullet.yack	51
GULLET	37929	But it's a reflex, isn't it? I can't really stop doing it.	Gullet.yack	52
GULLET	37930	And, it feels like drowning the whole time.	Gullet.yack	53
GULLET	37931	So get me out of here right now, you colossal git!	Gullet.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	37932	I'm the only one who knows you're down here...	Gullet.yack	56
GULLET	37933	Not true! I know I'm down here, don't I?	Gullet.yack	57
GUYBRUSH	37934	I guess you've got me there.	Gullet.yack	58
GULLET	37935	(smug)Hah!	Gullet.yack	59
GUYBRUSH	37936	If I leave you here, do you think you can free yourself?	Gullet.yack	61
GULLET	37937	Of course not! You think I haven't tried that already?!	Gullet.yack	62		UPDATE
GULLET	37938	It's a matter of leverage.	Gullet.yack	63
GULLET	37939	As in, I'm gonna get a lever and smack you in the head with it if you don't get me out of here right now!	Gullet.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	37940	Once we set sail, you'll probably be crushed into paste by the rudder.	Gullet.yack	66
GULLET	37941	Why would you tell me that?	Gullet.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	37942	In case you're worried about being stuck for a long time.	Gullet.yack	68
GULLET	37943	When I get my hands on you, I'm going to eat both your legs, throw them up, and then eat them all over again!	Gullet.yack	69		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37944	It would be smart of me not to give you the opportunity, then.	Gullet.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	37945	Nice talking to you, Gullet.	Gullet.yack	72
GULLET	37946	What do you mean, “nice talking to you?”	Gullet.yack	73
GUYBRUSH	37947	Oh I don't mean it literally, of course.	Gullet.yack	74
GUYBRUSH	37948	Just politely ending our conversation.	Gullet.yack	75
GULLET	37949	Wait, no, no, get me out of here for pity's sake!	Gullet.yack	76		UPDATE
GULLET	37950	You baboon! I'll get you for this!	Gullet.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	37951	Can I get you anything?	Gullet.yack	83
GULLET	37952	You can tell whoever's been turning the ship's wheel to knock it off! I could lose a leg or something!	Gullet.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	37953	I'll be sure to pass that along.	Gullet.yack	89
GULLET	37954	You can get me un-stuck from this rudder, thank you very much, you insufferable slug!	Gullet.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	37955	I was thinking more like a breath mint.	Gullet.yack	95
GUYBRUSH	37956	I don't think so.	Gullet.yack	97
GULLET	37957	Argh!	Gullet.yack	99
GULLET	37958	When do you think you might see your editor friend?	Gullet.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	37959	Soon.	Gullet.yack	105
GULLET	37960	Okay.	Gullet.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	37961	Not for a while.	Gullet.yack	107
GULLET	37962	(disappointed)Well, when you get the time.	Gullet.yack	108
GUYBRUSH	37963	Who?	Gullet.yack	109
GULLET	37964	You joking with me? You are. You remember. About the poems, right?	Gullet.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	37965	Just pulling your leg. I don't want to do it literally, you might lose something.	Gullet.yack	111
GULLET	37966	Uh... right.	Gullet.yack	112
GULLET	37967	Have you finished reading my poems yet?	Gullet.yack	120
GUYBRUSH	37968	They're just so fascinating, I'd like to spend more time with them.	Gullet.yack	121
GULLET	37969	Oh, uh, of course!	Gullet.yack	122		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37970	Hello again.	Gullet.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	37971	Hey.	Gullet.yack	137
GULLET	37972	Again? I don't know you. I'd remember an ugly mug like yours!	Gullet.yack	147
GUYBRUSH	37973	My mistake. See you later.	Gullet.yack	148
GULLET	37974	No wait! Only joking.	Gullet.yack	149
GULLET	37975	Hang about, maybe you can give me a hand. I'm a bit stuck.	Gullet.yack	150
GULLET	37976	What do you want?	Gullet.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	37977	Did I see you stuff a notebook into your shirt?	Gullet.yack	156
GULLET	37978	It's nothing you need to know about. Go away.	Gullet.yack	158
GUYBRUSH	37979	What's in the notebook? Is it a diary?	Gullet.yack	160
GULLET	37980	Look, it's, it... it's poems, all right? Zombie pirate poems. But, but they're not finished, I've got some... problems to work out with them still.	Gullet.yack	163		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37981	Would you describe your poems as “secret”?	Gullet.yack	165
GULLET	37982	Until such time as the world discovers my brilliance, yeah, I guess I would do. So what?	Gullet.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	37983	Maybe I could help you with your poetry.	Gullet.yack	168
GUYBRUSH	37984	I've dangled a metaphor or two in my day.	Gullet.yack	169
GUYBRUSH	37985	Now that they're finished, would you show me your poems?	Gullet.yack	171
GUYBRUSH	37986	Now that they're finished, would you show me your poems?	Gullet.yack	172
GULLET	37987	What, so you can steal them? Ho ho ho, I don't think so.	Gullet.yack	174		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37988	Okay. Honestly I have no idea why I'm even asking.	Gullet.yack	176
GUYBRUSH	37989	It's not YOUR secrets I'm interested in, after all.	Gullet.yack	177
GUYBRUSH	37990	Can I please have a look at your poems?	Gullet.yack	179
GULLET	37991	I haven't finished with them.	Gullet.yack	180
GUYBRUSH	37992	Do you happen to know LeChuck's catchphrase?	Gullet.yack	182
GULLET	37993	No. Whenever he's yelling I get too distracted counting his teeth to pay attention.	Gullet.yack	183		UPDATE
GULLET	37994	Got me in trouble a few times.	Gullet.yack	184		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37995	Would you happen to know LeChuck's favorite food?	Gullet.yack	186
GULLET	37996	I've got better things to do than to watch that guy eat.	Gullet.yack	187
GUYBRUSH	37997	Do you know if LeChuck has a theme song?	Gullet.yack	189
GULLET	37998	Does the screaming of his enemies count?	Gullet.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	37999	I doubt it.	Gullet.yack	191
GULLET	38000	Then no.	Gullet.yack	192
GUYBRUSH	38001	How did you get stuck on the rudder?	Gullet.yack	194
GULLET	38002	I was just doing me job, breaking in a new swab.	Gullet.yack	195		UPDATE
GULLET	38003	(aside) Ah, that's not bad. Lob, fob, gob- oh, gob! Gob could work.	Gullet.yack	196		UPDATE
GULLET	38004	Anyway, let's just say that upper management took exception to my methods, and here I am.	Gullet.yack	197
GUYBRUSH	38005	The new swab you mentioned, what was he like?	Gullet.yack	199
GUYBRUSH	38006	Rising star, diamond in the rough?	Gullet.yack	200
GULLET	38007	A useless plank. I don't think he knows one end of the mop from the other.	Gullet.yack	201
GULLET	38008	Also, he come down here, stole a knife I was keeping in my back, and left me stuck! Didn't even try to help!	Gullet.yack	202		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	38009	Maybe if you'd been nicer to that swab, he'd have helped you.	Gullet.yack	204
GULLET	38010	Not him. Sometimes you can just tell about people.	Gullet.yack	205
GUYBRUSH	38011	Did you ever think maybe you deserve to be left down here because you're a cruel bully with self-esteem issues?	Gullet.yack	207
GULLET	38012	No.	Gullet.yack	208		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	38013	Enjoy your evening.	Gullet.yack	210
GULLET	38014	You're leaving without helping me?	Gullet.yack	211
GULLET	38015	When I get out of here, I'm going to eat what little there is of your brain and use your broken ribs to pick my teeth.	Gullet.yack	212
GUYBRUSH	38016	Enjoy your evening.	Gullet.yack	214
GULLET	38017	Not likely.	Gullet.yack	215
GULLET	38018	Well, I am stuck in a few places...	Gullet.yack	221
GULLET	38019	For instance, what rhymes with “worms”?	Gullet.yack	223
GUYBRUSH	38020	Germs.	Gullet.yack	224
GUYBRUSH	38021	Words.	Gullet.yack	226
GUYBRUSH	38022	Squirms.	Gullet.yack	228
GUYBRUSH	38023	Pachyderms.	Gullet.yack	230
GUYBRUSH	38024	Septicemia.	Gullet.yack	232
GULLET	38025	Blank verse, then? I suppose other poets do get away with that sometimes...	Gullet.yack	234
GULLET	38026	Oh, yeah, that could work!	Gullet.yack	237
GULLET	38027	All right then, I also need an idea for something that grows.	Gullet.yack	240
GUYBRUSH	38028	Maggots.	Gullet.yack	241
GUYBRUSH	38029	Roses.	Gullet.yack	243
GUYBRUSH	38030	Rocks.	Gullet.yack	245
GULLET	38031	That changes the meaning a bit, but I do like it...	Gullet.yack	247
GUYBRUSH	38032	Earwax.	Gullet.yack	249
GUYBRUSH	38033	Resentment.	Gullet.yack	251
GULLET	38034	I think that fits.	Gullet.yack	254
GULLET	38035	How about a rhyme for “black”?	Gullet.yack	258
GUYBRUSH	38036	Snack.	Gullet.yack	260
GUYBRUSH	38037	Yak.	Gullet.yack	262
GUYBRUSH	38038	Fanatic.	Gullet.yack	264
GULLET	38039	Fanatic! Yeah, that could go in there. I don't think I'd have come up with that on my own.	Gullet.yack	266		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	38040	Cracked.	Gullet.yack	268
GUYBRUSH	38041	Orange.	Gullet.yack	270
GULLET	38042	Orange! Very avant-garde, I would never have dared, but you're giving me courage.	Gullet.yack	272
GULLET	38043	Right, of course, very nice.	Gullet.yack	275
GULLET	38044	Thanks a lot. I was a bit underwater there, but I think at least I can call the first volume wrapped up now.	Gullet.yack	281
GULLET	38045	I suppose that'd be all right, seeing as how you contributed, in a small way.	Gullet.yack	286
GULLET	38046	Let's keep it between us for now, though, don't go showing these around.	Gullet.yack	295
GUYBRUSH	38047	I wouldn't dream of it.	Gullet.yack	296
GUYBRUSH	38048	Hi.	Gullet.yack	312
GULLET	38049	Ghaa!	Gullet.yack	313
GULLET	39391	(frightened)What are you?!	Gullet.yack	314
GUYBRUSH	39392	I'm you, obviously.	Gullet.yack	316
GUYBRUSH	39393	I'm your long lost twin.	Gullet.yack	317
GUYBRUSH	39394	I am the spectre of your doom!	Gullet.yack	318
GUYBRUSH	39395	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate.	Gullet.yack	319
GULLET	39396	Oh.	Gullet.yack	323
GULLET	39397	Wait, that doesn't make sense. If you're me, then who am I?	Gullet.yack	324
GUYBRUSH	39398	You're me, of course.	Gullet.yack	326
GULLET	39399	Wouldn't I be over there in that case, and you'd be over here?	Gullet.yack	327
GUYBRUSH	39400	Normally. Except I'm the one stuck on the rudder.	Gullet.yack	328
GUYBRUSH	39401	You're also you. I'm from the future.	Gullet.yack	329
GUYBRUSH	39402	I came back to tell you that we never invent time travel.	Gullet.yack	330
GULLET	39403	We never...	Gullet.yack	331
GUYBRUSH	39404	You're a figment of my imagination.	Gullet.yack	332
GULLET	39405	I'd never have imagined that I'd be a figment of someone else's imagination.	Gullet.yack	333
GUYBRUSH	39406	Or your own. Don't forget I'm you.	Gullet.yack	334
GULLET	39407	Aw, now you're just making my brain hurt!	Gullet.yack	336
GULLET	39408	I'd like you to leave now.	Gullet.yack	337
GUYBRUSH	39409	Mullet.	Gullet.yack	342
GULLET	39410	No... Mullet disappeared over ninety years ago!	Gullet.yack	343
GULLET	39411	And we were fraternal twins, not identical!	Gullet.yack	344
GULLET	39412	You cannot be Mullet!	Gullet.yack	345
GUYBRUSH	39413	I've been trying to be more like you.	Gullet.yack	347
GULLET	39414	You always were a gutless little git without a personality of your own, Mullet!	Gullet.yack	348
GUYBRUSH	39415	Fraternal twins look more alike as they age.	Gullet.yack	349
GUYBRUSH	39416	It's a scientific fact.	Gullet.yack	350
GULLET	39417	I don't want to look or otherwise be anything like you, Mullet, you worthless toad.	Gullet.yack	351
GUYBRUSH	39418	You wouldn't recognize your own foot if it fell off and kicked you in the backside!	Gullet.yack	352
GULLET	39419	Mullet! Is that you?	Gullet.yack	353
GULLET	39420	The memories are flooding back!	Gullet.yack	354
GULLET	39421	Mainly, memories of how much we hate each other!	Gullet.yack	355
GULLET	39422	Even after ninety years I can't stand the sight of you!	Gullet.yack	357
GULLET	39423	Kindly get lost for another ninety!	Gullet.yack	358
GUYBRUSH	39424	Er... okay?	Gullet.yack	359
GULLET	39425	Give my best to Mum if you see her.	Gullet.yack	360
GUYBRUSH	39426	(ghostly and ominous)You should have been nicer to that swabbie.	Gullet.yack	365
GULLET	39427	You'll have to narrow it down a bit. Which swabbie?	Gullet.yack	366
GUYBRUSH	39428	The handsome one.	Gullet.yack	368
GULLET	39429	Oh, right. Shiny Roger. With the teeth.	Gullet.yack	369
GULLET	39430	I got a pretty penny for those teeth.	Gullet.yack	370
GUYBRUSH	39431	The clever one.	Gullet.yack	371
GULLET	39432	Don't think I've ever had a clever one.	Gullet.yack	372
GUYBRUSH	39433	The most recent one.	Gullet.yack	373
GULLET	39434	The most recent one? He was a useless wet rag.	Gullet.yack	374
GULLET	39435	Couldn't tell a mop from a stick.	Gullet.yack	375
GULLET	39436	You're the spectre of what, now?	Gullet.yack	377
GUYBRUSH	39437	Doom. Your doom, I think I mentioned.	Gullet.yack	378
GULLET	39438	Well, it seems like you're a bit late.	Gullet.yack	379
GULLET	39439	In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a half-rotten zombie stuck underwater on a rudder.	Gullet.yack	380
GULLET	39440	I think your job's done already. You can run along now.	Gullet.yack	381
GUYBRUSH	39441	Okay.	Gullet.yack	382
GULLET	39442	The twit LeChuck's always banging on about?	Gullet.yack	387
GULLET	39443	I've been underwater too long, I'm starting to hallucinate.	Gullet.yack	388
GULLET	39444	Maybe if I ignore it, it'll go away.	Gullet.yack	389
GUYBRUSH	39445	Hi.	Gullet.yack	394
GULLET	39446	Get lost, Mullet. As far as I'm concerned I have no brother.	Gullet.yack	395
GULLET	39447	Go away! I've already got a headache.	Gullet.yack	396

TOOTHROT	31529	“Reginald unfurled the perfumed missive, and slid his eyes along it: ‘Oh! My lovely privateer, lend me your most private ear...’ And so it continued saucily!”	HermansHideout.dinky	256
TOOTHROT	31530	“‘My sweetest lily pad,’ Reginald harked, ‘won't you come on down to my brigantine?’ Throwing her hand to her head, Cornelia replied, ‘Alas, you know I cannot leave my station.’”	HermansHideout.dinky	257
GUYBRUSH	39899	(Falling down pit, hitting walls and cliffs)Oof!	HermansHideout.dinky	258
TOOTHROT	31532	“Reginald swooped and swirled with his ink pen, ‘From my crow's nest, I look upon your alabaster parapets, which recline atop your municipal office.’”	HermansHideout.dinky	259
TOOTHROT	31533	“Cornelia's betrothed was a vile, vicious, and reviled little Lord of the moniker Lazlo Smerk. He sneered, ‘Remember, my dear, whose vote you'll require to retain your title and office!’ They both paused. ‘Mine!’ he then said.”	HermansHideout.dinky	260
TOOTHROT	31534	“Day and night at sea, Reginald sent homing pigeons, praying that one would return with a note from his beloved, or a lacy kerchief, or a bit of her hair, etc. But they really weren't sea birds at all.”	HermansHideout.dinky	261		UPDATE
TOOTHROT	31535	“Reginald and Cornelia leaned in close, hidden among her begonias. ‘We mustn't!’ She whispered. ‘We ought'nt!’ He agreed. ‘We dursn't!’ They cried in unison.”	HermansHideout.dinky	262
TOOTHROT	31536	“His crew danced merrily, but Reginald moped. Every wheeze of the concertina only reminded him of his missing lover's voice.”	HermansHideout.dinky	263
GUYBRUSH	39900	(Falling down pit, hitting walls and cliffs)Oof!	HermansHideout.dinky	263
TOOTHROT	31537	“All day, she sighed at her desk and stamped the municipal envelopes to the rhythm of her in-love heart.”	HermansHideout.dinky	264
TOOTHROT	31538	“‘But why must you go, when you know I cannot follow?’ she pled. He orated, ‘You know I promised my father I'd catch the great turquoise narwhal!’ At this, she yelped, ‘Oh cursed narwhal!’”	HermansHideout.dinky	265
TOOTHROT	31539	“Spotting her lover's ship on the horizon, Cornelia laughed and cried at the same time. Little did she know that Lazlo and his goons had set their trap down by the port!”	HermansHideout.dinky	266
TOOTHROT	31540	“‘You'll answer for your crimes, you nasty turquoise narwhal!’ shouted Reginald as he trapped the beast in a special no-harm cage, made special for this trip.”	HermansHideout.dinky	267
TOOTHROT	31541	“‘Lazlo's goons brandished their cutlasses at the lady and the tusked mammal. ‘Now you must choose,’ he cried, ‘your precious turquoise narwhal, or your true love! Who is also my fiancée.’”	HermansHideout.dinky	268
GUYBRUSH	39901	(Falling down pit, hitting walls and cliffs)Oof!	HermansHideout.dinky	268
TOOTHROT	31542	“‘You know I cannot abandon my office,’ Cornelia chided. ‘You know I am the top diplomat in the tri-county area!’ Reginald palmed his face, ‘Alas, why must I be in love with the Toastmaster General?’”	HermansHideout.dinky	269
TOOTHROT	31543	“Their weekend was a tumult of sweet nothings, swooning, spooning, and horse drawn carriage rides in good weather.”	HermansHideout.dinky	270
TOOTHROT	31544	“Reginald had told her many times why he must hunt the turquoise narwhal, his deathbed promise to his father, and the family honor at stake. ‘But what if you didn't?’ she offered.”	HermansHideout.dinky	271
TOOTHROT	31545	“‘If you cannot stand him, then why did you betroth him?’ remarked Reginald. Camilla rejoined, ‘Betrothal is a complicated social construct these days, and it would take a long time to explain.’”	HermansHideout.dinky	272

GUYBRUSH	31550	“Many of the many make the many more, while a few of the few make the few fewer.”	HermansHideout.dinky	282
GUYBRUSH	31551	“A few of the many are the few.”	HermansHideout.dinky	283
GUYBRUSH	31552	“Too few many, too many few? Or the other way around?”	HermansHideout.dinky	284
GUYBRUSH	31553	“Footwear is the enemy of compassion. Soles do not promote souls.”	HermansHideout.dinky	285
GUYBRUSH	31554	“Government should be humble, like a good cheese.”	HermansHideout.dinky	286

GUYBRUSH	31557	“Cast off your chains and replace them with shackles!”	HermansHideout.dinky	289
GUYBRUSH	31558	“Teaching a man to fish is less useful if he lives in a cave without fish.”	HermansHideout.dinky	290
GUYBRUSH	31559	“The rock is the foot of the stage. The foot is the stage of the philosopher.”	HermansHideout.dinky	291

GUYBRUSH	31563	“Free will is an illusion. Especially when you are trapped at the bottom of a cave.”	HermansHideout.dinky	295
GUYBRUSH	31564	“If a man is trapped at the bottom of a cave and he screams, does he hear himself?”	HermansHideout.dinky	296

TOOTHROT	31584	It ran out of oil after I'd been here about three days and then it got a little broken. I've been using it to catch rats.	HermansHideout.dinky	589
GUYBRUSH	31585	A lamp rat trap is pretty ingenious.	HermansHideout.dinky	594

GUYBRUSH	31589	Hi, Carl.	HermansHideout.dinky	622
TOOTHROT	31590	Carl won't likely say much until he knows you better.	HermansHideout.dinky	627
HOVER	10722	Maybe I can climb out?	HermansHideout.dinky	638
TOOTHROT	31591	I wouldn't climb that if I were you. The loud scorpions live up that way, ever since they ate all the giant spiders.	HermansHideout.dinky	642
TOOTHROT	31592	Of course, the spiders only came around to eat all the eelworms and megapedes.	HermansHideout.dinky	642

HINT	25801	Maybe a written apology would be enough for Carla?	HintSystemAct1.yack	243
HINT	25802	Use your pen on the forgiveness frog to craft an apology for Carla.	HintSystemAct1.yack	245
HINT	25803	You didn’t even address your apology to Carla. Use your pen on the frog to re-write it, this time making sure to address it to her.	HintSystemAct1.yack	247
HINT	25804	Your apology doesn't say anything about losing Carla's book. Use your pen on the frog to re-write your apology, this time write that you're sorry for losing the book.	HintSystemAct1.yack	249
HINT	25805	You should own up to your actions when apologizing. Use your pen on the frog to re-write your apology, this time don’t say it wasn’t your fault.	HintSystemAct1.yack	251
HINT	25806	Try giving Carla the forgiveness frog.	HintSystemAct1.yack	253
HINT	25807	The apology you wrote wasn’t good enough for Carla. You’ll have to do a better job personalizing it.	HintSystemAct1.yack	255

HINT	25812	There’s a statue of Carla on Low Street, read the plaque below it to learn about her accomplishments.	HintSystemAct1.yack	265
HINT	25813	You’ve learned few things about Carla’s accomplishments, try using that information to personalize your apology.	HintSystemAct1.yack	267
HINT	25814	Use your pen on the forgiveness frog and mention the information you learned from Carla’s election poster near the Scumm Bar and her statue on Low Street in your apology.	HintSystemAct1.yack	269
HINT	25815	Now that you’ve written a personalized apology on it, try giving Carla the forgiveness frog.	HintSystemAct1.yack	271

HINT	25822	Go to the forest near the museum on the Mêlée Island overview, then use the mop map to navigate the forest.	HintSystemAct1.yack	297
HINT	25823	Your map shows you the path through the forest. Use the map to work out which path (up, left, or right) you need to take until you reach the mop tree.	HintSystemAct1.yack	301
HINT	25824	Pay close attention to the placement of the flowers.	HintSystemAct1.yack	303

HINT	25830	Have you seen anything in your travels that could be used as a mop head?	HintSystemAct1.yack	320
HINT	25831	Try looking around town and around Mêlée Island more to find something.	HintSystemAct1.yack	324
HINT	25832	Almost anything can become a mop head. Including string, toys, sponges, and shrunken heads.	HintSystemAct1.yack	328
HINT	25833	You can find mop heads out the back of the kitchen, in the governor's mansion, at Stan's old shipyard, and in the Voodoo Shop.	HintSystemAct1.yack	333
HINT	25834	Drag a possible mop head onto the mop handle to combine them into a mop.	HintSystemAct1.yack	337
HINT	25835	Drag your mop head item (either tangled string, stuffed animal, dried sea sponge, or shrunken head) onto the mop handle to combine it to make a complete mop.	HintSystemAct1.yack	340
HINT	25836	I need another hint...	HintSystemAct1.yack	344

HINT	25843	Never mind.	HintSystemAct1.yack	367
HINT	25844	You will need to disguise yourself.	HintSystemAct1.yack	379
HINT	25845	No ordinary disguise will be enough to trick the crew, perhaps you need a magical one?	HintSystemAct1.yack	381
HINT	25846	Search outside of town for somewhere a magical artifact would be displayed.	HintSystemAct1.yack	385
HINT	25847	Enter the forest on the outskirts of town and follow the signage to the museum on the right. Maybe you'll find something useful there.	HintSystemAct1.yack	387
HINT	25848	The museum outside of town might have a useful object on display.	HintSystemAct1.yack	393
HINT	25849	Talk to the museum curator more.	HintSystemAct1.yack	395

GUYBRUSH	31949	I've come this far without being pecked to death by ghost chickens.	Hold.dinky	910
GUYBRUSH	31950	Keep your expectations modest, I always say.	Hold.dinky	910

HOVER	11841	Leave the Ice Quarry	IceQuarry.dinky	81
HOVER	11842	What's this?	IceQuarry.dinky	88
GUYBRUSH	32942	It looks like a secret escape tunnel.	IceQuarry.dinky	91
HOVER	11843	Escape!	IceQuarry.dinky	95
HOVER	11844	Prison shackles?	IceQuarry.dinky	105

HOVER	11875	It's just a stump	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	133
GUYBRUSH	32994	Is there anything special about this stump?	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	136
GUARD	32995	No. Why?	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	138
GUYBRUSH	32996	It was tagged, so I thought, you know, maybe there would be a great gag about a secret opening to a system of tunnels or something like that.	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	140
GUARD	32997	{excuse_me}Please don't joke about tunnels next to the prison, sir.	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	142
GUYBRUSH	32998	Nice stump.	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	144
HOVER	11876	What's that?	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	152
GUYBRUSH	32999	What's that thing?	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	157

HOVER	11878	Is he in the Chums?	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	166
GUYBRUSH	33001	Are you in the Chums?	IceQuarryGuardPost.dinky	172

LECHUCK	30436	Now, before we can follow the map, obviously we must make our way to Monkey Island itself.	Inspiring.dinky	49
LECHUCK	30437	Let's have the potion report.	Inspiring.dinky	51
PUTRA	30438	The potion is nearly finished, captain.	Inspiring.dinky	60

BOYBRUSH	34943	Wait, there's a potion?	Inspiring.yack	15
GUYBRUSH	34944	You don't remember that from my other story?	Inspiring.yack	16
GUYBRUSH	34945	To get to Monkey Island you have to brew a special potion.	Inspiring.yack	17
BOYBRUSH	34946	[silent]But you and LeChuck had both been there before.	Inspiring.yack	20
BOYBRUSH	34947	But you and LeChuck had both been there before.	Inspiring.yack	21
BOYBRUSH	34948	Why couldn't you just sail there?	Inspiring.yack	22
GUYBRUSH	34949	It doesn't work like that. You have to make the potion every time.	Inspiring.yack	23
BOYBRUSH	34950	[silent]How does the potion work?	Inspiring.yack	25
BOYBRUSH	34951	How does the potion work?	Inspiring.yack	26

GUYBRUSH	34956	It's got squid ink and monkey blood. And a pressed skull, I definitely remember that.	Inspiring.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	34957	Also cinnamon, mint, and brimstone. And some coloring and preservatives.	Inspiring.yack	33
GUYBRUSH	34958	Oh, and a live chicken. But listen, you shouldn't worry about this yet. Wait 'til you're twelve or so.	Inspiring.yack	35

GUYBRUSH	34963	I have a common sort of face.	Inspiring.yack	56
LECHUCK	34964	I suppose everyone looks the same with the skin peeled off.	Inspiring.yack	57
GUYBRUSH	34965	We met about an hour ago.	Inspiring.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	34966	While Iron Rose was introducing me around.	Inspiring.yack	59

LECHUCK	34972	Go and get us a skull.	Inspiring.yack	66
LECHUCK	34973	A flat one.	Inspiring.yack	67
LECHUCK	34974	Any questions?	Inspiring.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	34975	Why do we need a skull?	Inspiring.yack	71
LECHUCK	34976	To finish the voodoo potion! We just went over this!	Inspiring.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	34977	Why does it have to be a flat skull?	Inspiring.yack	74
LECHUCK	34978	Because the recipe says so!	Inspiring.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	34979	Where should I look for a skull?	Inspiring.yack	77

HOVER	10379	Examine the arm bone	InventoryAE.dinky	131
GUYBRUSH	31168	Could be a humerus, or maybe the ulna. It's hard to tell without some deep forensic analysis.	InventoryAE.dinky	133
GUYBRUSH	31169	Based on the decay of the muscle and tendons, I would say they've been dead for 10-15 years.	InventoryAE.dinky	134
GUYBRUSH	31170	There's a small stress-fracture indicating some kind of trauma.	InventoryAE.dinky	135
GUYBRUSH	31171	The fracture shows pronounced healing so it's unlikely it's the cause of death.	InventoryAE.dinky	136
GUYBRUSH	31172	The bone does suffer from osteoporosis so it might be from an older person.	InventoryAE.dinky	137

GUYBRUSH	30966	Nuts.	InventoryFK.dinky	233

GUYBRUSH	30981	Gross, looks like day-old avocado soup.	InventoryFK.dinky	499
HOVER	10307	Consider the origins of the antique knife	InventoryFK.dinky	507
GUYBRUSH	30982	It's Flair Gorey's grandmother's whale knife.	InventoryFK.dinky	509

FLAIRGOREY	30986	I have no idea how you pulled that off, but, I guess a deal's a deal.	InventoryFK.dinky	539
FLAIRGOREY	30987	I'll vote for your stupid plan.	InventoryFK.dinky	540
GUYBRUSH	30988	What do you think of this beautiful antique?	InventoryFK.dinky	544
FLAIRGOREY	30989	That's my grandmother's whale knife! How weird, I could have sworn I left it in Gullet's back.	InventoryFK.dinky	549
FLAIRGOREY	30990	Thanks, swabbie, I owe you one.	InventoryFK.dinky	550
GUYBRUSH	30991	Can I count on you to back me next time we vote on going to Monkey Island?	InventoryFK.dinky	553

GUYBRUSH	38606	I'll remember that.	InventoryFK.dinky	559
HOVER	10310	Try to remember why I'm carrying a frog	InventoryFK.dinky	580
GUYBRUSH	30993	It's a “forgiveness frog,” but I juiced it up with a written apology.	InventoryFK.dinky	584
GUYBRUSH	30994	The Voodoo Lady said it was a “forgiveness frog.”	InventoryFK.dinky	586
GUYBRUSH	30995	Apparently a “forgiveness frog” doesn't work if the apology you write on it isn't good enough.	InventoryFK.dinky	589
HOVER	10311	Apologize with the forgiveness frog	InventoryFK.dinky	593
GUYBRUSH	30996	Nothing says “I'm sorry” like a dried up old frog.	InventoryFK.dinky	598

GUYBRUSH	31001	It's a forgiveness frog. For when words aren't enough.	InventoryFK.dinky	626
CARLA	31002	That is complete nonsense!	InventoryFK.dinky	628
CARLA	31003	...and yet...	InventoryFK.dinky	630

CARLA	31006	I can't even explain why, I just have this sudden, inexplicable urge to forgive.	InventoryFK.dinky	638
CARLA	31007	You'd better not be up to something.	InventoryFK.dinky	640

HOVER	10318	Season the crackers with Demon Pepper	InventoryFK.dinky	772

HOVER	10324	Gaze at the painting	InventoryFK.dinky	1006
GUYBRUSH	31061	It's a torn painting of Elaine that's supposed to have me in it.	InventoryFK.dinky	1011

HOVER	10330	Compare Stan's picture next to Ned's	InventoryFK.dinky	1069
GUYBRUSH	31064	A perfect match. They were once a single painting until they were ripped apart.	InventoryFK.dinky	1072
GUYBRUSH	31065	How symbolic!	InventoryFK.dinky	1072
HOVER	10331	Criticize the painting	InventoryFK.dinky	1082
GUYBRUSH	31066	I think they've captured Stan quite well, actually. They did a nice job with the coat.	InventoryFK.dinky	1087

OTIS	31075	Typical bureaucrats.	InventoryFK.dinky	1147
GUYBRUSH	31076	What would you say if I told you the governor authorized funds for the rebuilding of the Scumm Bar at an unspecified future date?	InventoryFK.dinky	1155
COOK	31077	She did? That's fantastic!	InventoryFK.dinky	1160
COOK	31078	I'll have a sunken area that catches grog spills for recycling, and a medical triage room...	InventoryFK.dinky	1162
COOK	31079	Excuse me. Lots to plan!	InventoryFK.dinky	1164
COOK	31080	I'm not sure why my hard earned taxes should go to fixing your keel?	InventoryFK.dinky	1170
COOK	31081	Do we really need to coddle our prisoners with an influenza free jail?	InventoryFK.dinky	1175
GUYBRUSH	39796	What would you say if I told you the governor authorized funds to overhaul the keel of my ship?	InventoryFK.dinky	1176
COOK	31083	Repairing the shipyard is good for the economy. I'm pro business.	InventoryFK.dinky	1185
GUYBRUSH	39797	What would you say if I told you the governor authorized funds for repairing the jail?	InventoryFK.dinky	1185
COOK	31084	Fixing the street feels like a bureaucratic boondoggle.	InventoryFK.dinky	1190
GUYBRUSH	39798	What would you say if I told you the governor authorized funds to build an amusement park on Mêlée?	InventoryFK.dinky	1194
HOVER	10336	Ask to revise the IOU for a different project	InventoryFK.dinky	1196

HOVER	12420	Thank goodness I brought my trusty horse armor	InventoryFK.dinky	1204
HOVER	12421	Not the most promising underwater gear	InventoryFK.dinky	1205
GUYBRUSH	31085	I'll just add one more zero at the end.	InventoryFK.dinky	1206
HOVER	12422	Still looking for a way to use my trusty horse armor	InventoryFK.dinky	1206
HOVER	12423	I don't think there are any horses on Monkey Island	InventoryFK.dinky	1207

HOVER	12425	Really questioning the horse armor at this point	InventoryFK.dinky	1209
GUYBRUSH	39801	What would you say if I told you the governor authorized funds to fix the huge crack on Low Street?	InventoryFK.dinky	1212
GUYBRUSH	40877	This has gotten me out of a lot of scrapes over the years!	InventoryFK.dinky	1213
HOVER	10338	Appreciate the jail cell key	InventoryFK.dinky	1214
GUYBRUSH	31086	This is awesome. Now I can open one of the jail cells.	InventoryFK.dinky	1216
GUYBRUSH	40878	Still, you never know when you're going to run across a giant seahorse.	InventoryFK.dinky	1216
HOVER	10339	Unlock the jail cell with the key	InventoryFK.dinky	1218
GUYBRUSH	40879	I haven't worked out where they keep the ship's horse yet.	InventoryFK.dinky	1219
GUYBRUSH	40880	Maybe I can book a side trip to Horsey Island.	InventoryFK.dinky	1222
GUYBRUSH	40881	But nothing's going to keep me from getting The Secret!	InventoryFK.dinky	1226
GUYBRUSH	40882	It's a big world. I'm confident I'll find a use for this soon.	InventoryFK.dinky	1228
GUYBRUSH	40883	But I make a policy of standing by even my most ridiculous choices.	InventoryFK.dinky	1232
GUYBRUSH	40884	I'm pretty sure horses don't like lava.	InventoryFK.dinky	1234
STAN	31087	No thanks. I'm about to be acquitted. Escaping looks bad.	InventoryFK.dinky	1237
HOVER	12426	Ask Stan if he could use my horse armor	InventoryFK.dinky	1238
GUYBRUSH	31088	This key doesn't work in this lock.	InventoryFK.dinky	1239
GUYBRUSH	40885	Hey Stan, would a set of horse armor do you any good?	InventoryFK.dinky	1243
HOVER	10340	Show the jail cell key	InventoryFK.dinky	1244
STAN	40886	It already has! What a fantastic marketing gimmick! Everybody's a sucker for horse armor.	InventoryFK.dinky	1245
LOCKSMITH	31089	It's some of my most recent work!	InventoryFK.dinky	1248
HOVER	12427	Tell Elaine about the horse armor	InventoryFK.dinky	1249
STAN	31090	Say, that'd be quite a bargaining chip for me in here, but all Otis has to offer is a free case of second hand body odor.	InventoryFK.dinky	1252
STAN	31091	That's just a key to an empty cell now, son. It's lost all its market value.	InventoryFK.dinky	1254
GUYBRUSH	40887	I brought my trusty horse armor with me!	InventoryFK.dinky	1254
ELAINE	40888	But that's for next week! Have you been carrying that around all day?	InventoryFK.dinky	1256
OTIS	31092	You do it! I'm shaky from excitement! And from too much gruel and not enough grog.	InventoryFK.dinky	1258
GUYBRUSH	40889	(sheepish)Maybe.	InventoryFK.dinky	1258
HOVER	12428	Offer my horse armor for a museum exhibit	InventoryFK.dinky	1262
HOVER	10341	Read the serial number	InventoryFK.dinky	1267
GUYBRUSH	40890	You know what every good pirate museum needs? A set of horse armor!	InventoryFK.dinky	1267
GUYBRUSH	31093	This is the number for the jail cell lock.	InventoryFK.dinky	1269
HOVER	10342	Have a key made for the jail cell	InventoryFK.dinky	1272
LOCKSMITH	31094	Good choice on the lock. These are really sturdy.	InventoryFK.dinky	1279		UPDATE
LOCKSMITH	31095	It's the same kind they use over at the jail.	InventoryFK.dinky	1281
GUYBRUSH	31096	Uh...wow, what a coincidence! I had no idea.	InventoryFK.dinky	1283
HOVER	10343	Show the serial number	InventoryFK.dinky	1289
STAN	31097	That's a genuine lock serial number, alright. But, I'm no locksmith.	InventoryFK.dinky	1293
OTIS	31098	What are you showing that to me for? Take it to the locksmith.	InventoryFK.dinky	1296
HOVER	10344	Skim the joke book	InventoryFK.dinky	1304
GUYBRUSH	31099	It's Flambe's “Underworld Joke Book.” All jokes about demons and otherworldly stuff.	InventoryFK.dinky	1308
HOVER	10345	Give the joke book to Apple Bob	InventoryFK.dinky	1311
YARDARM	31100	Hey, this looks promising! Thanks! I owe you one.	InventoryFK.dinky	1325

YARDARM	31102	Sure, no problem.	InventoryFK.dinky	1329

GUYBRUSH	31103	He said I could have it for the rest of the day.	InventoryFK.dinky	1357
GUYBRUSH	31104	I wouldn't want to wake him up.	InventoryFK.dinky	1359

GUYBRUSH	30837	Okay, but... I need it more than you do. I have to have it!	InventorySZ.dinky	519
TOOTHROT	30838	If you say so.	InventorySZ.dinky	522
HOVER	10200	Skim the ship repair manual	InventorySZ.dinky	534
GUYBRUSH	30839	“Advanced Ship Repair for the Dummy Klutz.” It's like it was written just for me!	InventorySZ.dinky	537

GUYBRUSH	30842	It's a skull I found.	InventorySZ.dinky	604
GUYBRUSH	30843	Just some old skull.	InventorySZ.dinky	605

GUYBRUSH	30854	Wally, here's a sample of the wood you wanted. Can you make me a map now?	InventorySZ.dinky	727
GUYBRUSH	30855	Wally, here's a bit of wood. A “friend” told me you can make a map to where this tree grows?	InventorySZ.dinky	729
TEXT	20347	Ten minutes later...	InventorySZ.dinky	733
WALLY	30856	Sure, here it is.	InventorySZ.dinky	734

HOVER	10217	Peek inside Ned's satchel	InventorySZ.dinky	786
GUYBRUSH	30864	There is a lot of junk in here, but I think I see the evidence that will lock Stan up for a long long time.	InventorySZ.dinky	789
HOVER	10218	Rummage through Ned's satchel	InventorySZ.dinky	791

LECHUCK	30870	I do not address paperwork outside the captain's cabin!	InventorySZ.dinky	831
LECHUCK	30871	Read your employee handbook!	InventorySZ.dinky	831
LECHUCK	30872	Paperwork! Ok, hand it over.	InventorySZ.dinky	837
LECHUCK	30873	I feel like the supply of paperwork is endless.	InventorySZ.dinky	837		UPDATE

YARDARM	30875	Are you kidding? Reading those sounds like actual work! No thanks.	InventorySZ.dinky	874
HOVER	10226	Remind Rose about her paperwork	InventorySZ.dinky	880
IRONROSE	30876	I don't have time for that right now. It's all stuff LeChuck has to approve anyway.	InventorySZ.dinky	884
HOVER	10227	Forge LeChuck's signature	InventorySZ.dinky	888
GUYBRUSH	30877	I don't think I could mimic LeChuck's particular scrawl.	InventorySZ.dinky	893
GUYBRUSH	30878	These are signed already!	InventorySZ.dinky	895

GUYBRUSH	38589	Sadly empty.	InventorySZ.dinky	935
HOVER	12114	Examine the stone spyglass	InventorySZ.dinky	944
GUYBRUSH	38590	Not useable as an actual spyglass, due to its being a solid chunk of stone.	InventorySZ.dinky	946
GUYBRUSH	40827	How about a little light reading?	InventorySZ.dinky	952
HOVER	10228	Untangle the string	InventorySZ.dinky	956

GUYBRUSH	30893	Could you make tentacles with daisy sauce with this?	InventorySZ.dinky	1054
HOVER	10238	Taste the tentacles with daisy sauce	InventorySZ.dinky	1066
GUYBRUSH	30894	I'd rather not, honestly.	InventorySZ.dinky	1068
HOVER	10239	Hand over the tentacles with daisy sauce?	InventorySZ.dinky	1071
GUYBRUSH	30895	Actually I think I'll hold onto this for the spell. I don't have a lot of leverage in this partnership.	InventorySZ.dinky	1075
HOVER	10240	Open my todo list	InventorySZ.dinky	1092
HOVER	12115	My todo list is up to date	InventorySZ.dinky	1131

HOVER	10244	Inspect the toothbrush	InventorySZ.dinky	1142
GUYBRUSH	30900	It's old and the bristles are frayed, but it does resemble a toothbrush.	InventorySZ.dinky	1144
GUYBRUSH	30901	It's an old wooden toothbrush with badly frayed bristles that I found at Stan's shipyard.	InventorySZ.dinky	1145
HOVER	10245	Return the toothbrush	InventorySZ.dinky	1148

HOVER	10248	Offer Herman the key	InventorySZ.dinky	1221
GUYBRUSH	30907	I've got another Golden Key you could have.	InventorySZ.dinky	1225

GUYBRUSH	39645	I found these notes in the caves. Did you write them?	InventorySZ.dinky	1279
TOOTHROT	38593	I can't take credit for the work of the magnificent Anne Anson. Those are from At the End of the Plank!	InventorySZ.dinky	1281
HOVER	10256	Give her the carnivorous plant	InventorySZ.dinky	1289
VOODOOLADY	30913	I'm afraid I've got no further need for such a thing.	InventorySZ.dinky	1298
VOODOOLADY	30914	Thank you, but I'm trying to empty my shelves, not stock them.	InventorySZ.dinky	1300
HOVER	10257	Fear the carnivorous plant	InventorySZ.dinky	1308
HOVER	12346	Admire the trophy	InventorySZ.dinky	1308

GUYBRUSH	40720	I don't think it's LeChuck or Lila's size.	InventorySZ.dinky	1327
GUYBRUSH	30917	I'll wait until I'm closer to LeChuck's ship. No need to scare the Mêlée town folk.	InventorySZ.dinky	1331
GUYBRUSH	40721	Not sure how I feel about this being the secret.	InventorySZ.dinky	1331
ELAINE	40722	No matter what it was, could it have ever lived up to your expectations?	InventorySZ.dinky	1333
ELAINE	40723	On the bright side, it's 100% pre-washed cotton.	InventorySZ.dinky	1335
HOVER	10259	Take off the enchanted eyepatch	InventorySZ.dinky	1336
GUYBRUSH	40724	“Glass half-full.” That's why I married you.	InventorySZ.dinky	1337
GUYBRUSH	30918	I'd better leave it on while I'm on the ship.	InventorySZ.dinky	1343
GUYBRUSH	30919	I should move farther away from the quartermaster so she doesn't see me.	InventorySZ.dinky	1346

LOCKSMITH	30923	A shackle key, eh? Specially formulated alloy to withstand the corrosive nature of the sea.	InventorySZ.dinky	1384
GUYBRUSH	30924	They're great for securing my gear on board my ship.	InventorySZ.dinky	1387

GUYBRUSH	30927	Also, apparently the sign is magic!	InventorySZ.dinky	1467
GUYBRUSH	30928	Well, that wasn't so hard.	InventorySZ.dinky	1473
GUYBRUSH	30929	Also, apparently the sign is magic!	InventorySZ.dinky	1476

GUYBRUSH	36439	-ahem-	LeChuck.yack	23
LECHUCK	36440	I told ye to find a flattened skull! Do it before I decide to use yers instead!	LeChuck.yack	25
LECHUCK	36441	Put that skull in the pot and let's get on to Monkey Island!	LeChuck.yack	26
LECHUCK	36442	{yelling}(yelling)What do you want, swabbie?	LeChuck.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	36443	{confused}Why exactly are you trying to find The Secret of Monkey Island?	LeChuck.yack	39
LECHUCK	36444	The Secret of Monkey Island has tormented many a pirate.	LeChuck.yack	40
LECHUCK	36445	Some believe it doesn't exist. That it's just a myth. Or a joke concocted by a fool.	LeChuck.yack	41
LECHUCK	36446	None has been more obsessed over it than that idiot Guybrush.	LeChuck.yack	42
LECHUCK	36447	Me? I think it holds a mystical power to be harnessed for evil.	LeChuck.yack	43
LECHUCK	36448	And as an added bonus it will drive Threepweed over the edge of madness.	LeChuck.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	36449	{frustration}Threepwood. Wood. With two o's.	LeChuck.yack	45

GUYBRUSH	36452	Mind if I take a look at that map you were waving around earlier?	LeChuck.yack	49
LECHUCK	36453	Don't... touch... the map.	LeChuck.yack	50
LECHUCK	36454	That be the one true map to The Secret of Monkey Island!	LeChuck.yack	52
LECHUCK	36455	Procured by me at great expense and no small amount of trouble!	LeChuck.yack	53
LECHUCK	36456	So I'll not have you touching it, even with your eyeballs!	LeChuck.yack	54

GUYBRUSH	36458	Are you sure I can't take a peek at the map to The Secret?	LeChuck.yack	59
GUYBRUSH	36459	I just washed my hands.	LeChuck.yack	60
LECHUCK	36460	Touching that map is a short-cut to being keelhauled.	LeChuck.yack	61
GUYBRUSH	36461	I may have figured out a way to get to Monkey Island.	LeChuck.yack	63
GUYBRUSH	36462	I spotted another ship making a potion and we can just follow them!	LeChuck.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	36463	It says “LeChuck.”	LeChuck.yack	71
LECHUCK	36464	{yelling}(yelling)And LeChuck is a leader, not a follower!	LeChuck.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	36465	The voodoo potion spell thingamajig is coming along great.	LeChuck.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	36466	Nothing to worry about.	LeChuck.yack	76
LECHUCK	36467	{yelling}(yelling)Then... why are you bothering me about it!	LeChuck.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	36468	Just spit-balling here, but Putra really deserves a promotion.	LeChuck.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	36469	She makes a mean eyeball soup.	LeChuck.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	36470	And when I say “mean” I do mean that quite literally.	LeChuck.yack	83
LECHUCK	36471	Did she put you up to this?	LeChuck.yack	84
LECHUCK	36472	Putra has been trying to wrangle a promotion out of me for years.	LeChuck.yack	85
LECHUCK	36473	Go tell Putra her plan failed and to make sure she's at the keelhauling at four.	LeChuck.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	36474	Didn't Guybrush Threepwood get to Monkey Island years ago.	LeChuck.yack	88
LECHUCK	36475	{yelling}(yelling)Guybrush Threepwood is a fancy-pants wearing third rate sailor and a has-been pirate!	LeChuck.yack	89
LECHUCK	36476	{yelling}(yelling)He stole the woman I loved, and I will eat his heart at the gates of hell!	LeChuck.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	36477	Did you really “love” Elaine or was it more of a...	LeChuck.yack	92
LECHUCK	36478	{yelling}(yelling)My patience is wearing thin, swabbie!	LeChuck.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	36479	Nothing, never mind.	LeChuck.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	36480	I'll just go swab something.	LeChuck.yack	97
LECHUCK	36481	{yelling}(yelling)You! Swabbie! Come over here!	LeChuck.yack	104
LECHUCK	36482	Ye be new to my ship.	LeChuck.yack	112
LECHUCK	36483	I like to meet each of my crew.	LeChuck.yack	113
LECHUCK	36484	What's your name, swabbie?	LeChuck.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	36485	[silent]Guybru... Ah, Mike.	LeChuck.yack	115
GUYBRUSH	36486	Mike.	LeChuck.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	36487	Blood Sword the Feared.	LeChuck.yack	118
GUYBRUSH	36488	Crazy Beard the Beardless.	LeChuck.yack	119
GUYBRUSH	36489	Eye-gouger the Reckless.	LeChuck.yack	120
GUYBRUSH	36490	Swabbie is fine.	LeChuck.yack	121
GUYBRUSH	36491	I like what you've done with the place.	LeChuck.yack	122
LECHUCK	36492	Look, I'm just going to call you swabbie.	LeChuck.yack	126
LECHUCK	36493	It's not good for the chain-of-command if we get too friendly.	LeChuck.yack	127
LECHUCK	36494	(fast)Any questions? None? Good! I likes an unquestioning crew.	LeChuck.yack	131
LECHUCK	36495	Now get back to work before I use your entrails as bait!	LeChuck.yack	132		UPDATE
LECHUCK	36496	Wait!	LeChuck.yack	136
GUYBRUSH	36497	{worried}Uhhh.	LeChuck.yack	137
LECHUCK	36498	Don't forget the keelhauling tomorrow at four.	LeChuck.yack	138
LECHUCK	36499	I like to think of it as a team building exercise.	LeChuck.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	36500	I won't.	LeChuck.yack	141
LECHUCK	36501	One more thing swabbie!	LeChuck.yack	151
LECHUCK	36502	Now that you be first swab, you'll be needing to fill out the swabbie report.	LeChuck.yack	153
LECHUCK	36503	Take this report, fill it out and give it to Iron Rose for her initials.	LeChuck.yack	155
LECHUCK	36504	Some say it's grog that keeps a pirate ship running. It's not. It's paperwork.	LeChuck.yack	162
LECHUCK	36505	Is this about a promotion for Putra again? I've told her a hundred times, I'm never going to sign that!	LeChuck.yack	178
LECHUCK	33318	What does that nameplate say? The one there on my desk?	LeChuck.yack	184
LECHUCK	36506	{yelling}(yelling)Now get out of here so I can think!	LeChuck.yack	184
LECHUCK	38485	I suppose you think you're very clever.	LeChuckFight.yack	14
GUYBRUSH	38486	Let's just say I think one of us is more clever than the other.	LeChuckFight.yack	17
LECHUCK	38487	Let's just judge that according to which of us winds up with The Secret while the other one is BEING EATEN BY FISH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN!	LeChuckFight.yack	22
GUYBRUSH	38488	Right up to the part where I took off the eyepatch.	LeChuckFight.yack	24
GUYBRUSH	38489	I got carried away. I've really started to feel like part of the crew.	LeChuckFight.yack	26
LECHUCK	38490	Well you've already seen what happens to crew who displease me.	LeChuckFight.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	38491	Sorry, but I needed a ride.	LeChuckFight.yack	32
LECHUCK	38492	(menacing)Time to pay the fare.	LeChuckFight.yack	37
LECHUCK	38493	I want to savor this, so I'm going to let you have the first jab.	LeChuckFight.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	38494	You move like a wounded hippopotamus!	LeChuckFight.yack	63
LECHUCK	38495	You move like a dead one!	LeChuckFight.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	38496	I'm going to skewer you like a pig on a spit!	LeChuckFight.yack	65
LECHUCK	38497	You do fight more like a cook than a swordsman!	LeChuckFight.yack	66
GUYBRUSH	38498	You're as rusty as that butterknife you call a sword!	LeChuckFight.yack	67
LECHUCK	38499	We're both still sharper than you!	LeChuckFight.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	38500	Let's make this quick, I've got an appointment with a Secret.	LeChuckFight.yack	69
LECHUCK	38501	I'll cover that meeting, your innards have a prior engagement with the tip of my sword!	LeChuckFight.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	38502	Okay, decent comeback.	LeChuckFight.yack	76
LECHUCK	38503	Why don't you try again?	LeChuckFight.yack	79
GUYBRUSH	38504	You're all bluster and no lustre!	LeChuckFight.yack	82
LECHUCK	38505	Well you're all, uh... custard.	LeChuckFight.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	38506	You're all flavor and no sabre!	LeChuckFight.yack	84
LECHUCK	38507	Well your flavor is, uh... flavorless.	LeChuckFight.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	38508	You're all buttress and no cutlass!	LeChuckFight.yack	86
LECHUCK	38509	You're all mattress and, uh...	LeChuckFight.yack	87
GUYBRUSH	38510	You're all swagger and no dagger!	LeChuckFight.yack	88
LECHUCK	38511	I've got... plenty of dagger!	LeChuckFight.yack	89		UPDATE
LECHUCK	38512	Blast.	LeChuckFight.yack	92
GUYBRUSH	38513	Hey! Cheating! I won that round!	LeChuckFight.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	38514	Also I'm pretty sure we're supposed to use the swords when we do this.	LeChuckFight.yack	107
LECHUCK	38515	You don't seem to know how to use a sword.	LeChuckFight.yack	108
LECHUCK	38516	I can't decide if you're waving that thing like a feather duster, or more like a mop.	LeChuckFight.yack	109
BOYBRUSH	38517	Hey, I know that one!	LeChuckFight.yack	120
GUYBRUSH	38518	Been practicing, huh? What comeback would you use for “waving it like a feather duster or like a mop”?	LeChuckFight.yack	122
GUYBRUSH	38519	[silent]Like a conductor's baton!	LeChuckFight.yack	129
BOYBRUSH	38520	Like a conductor's baton!	LeChuckFight.yack	134
GUYBRUSH	38521	[silent]It's waving goodbye!	LeChuckFight.yack	136
BOYBRUSH	38522	It's waving goodbye!	LeChuckFight.yack	141
GUYBRUSH	38523	[silent]Either way I'll clean the floor with you!	LeChuckFight.yack	143
BOYBRUSH	38524	Either way I'll clean the floor with you!	LeChuckFight.yack	148
GUYBRUSH	38525	That's what I thought, too!	LeChuckFight.yack	156
LECHUCK	38526	I can't decide if you're waving your sword like a feather duster, or more like a mop.	LeChuckFight.yack	172
GUYBRUSH	38527	Like a conductor's baton!	LeChuckFight.yack	175
GUYBRUSH	38528	I picture you as a kettle drum in this scenario, you get hit a lot.	LeChuckFight.yack	176
LECHUCK	38529	I assume you're no better at conducting an orchestra than you are at conducting swordplay.	LeChuckFight.yack	178
LECHUCK	38530	Or metaphors.	LeChuckFight.yack	179
GUYBRUSH	38531	It's waving goodbye!	LeChuckFight.yack	183
LECHUCK	38532	More like a white flag, then.	LeChuckFight.yack	185
GUYBRUSH	38533	Either way I'll clean the floor with you!	LeChuckFight.yack	188
LECHUCK	38534	{yelling}(yelling)Too late to start doing your job now, “swabbie”!	LeChuckFight.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	38535	Hey! You're laying a comeback on my comeback? That's got to be against the rules.	LeChuckFight.yack	195
LECHUCK	38536	You really should keep up on the latest trends.	LeChuckFight.yack	197
LECHUCK	38537	Goodbye, Threepwood.	LeChuckFight.yack	198
GUYBRUSH	38538	Good thing I can still hold my breath for ten minutes. More or less.	LeChuckFight.yack	234
BOYBRUSH	38539	Is it more, or is it less?	LeChuckFight.yack	244
GUYBRUSH	38540	What?	LeChuckFight.yack	246
BOYBRUSH	38541	You say you can hold your breath for ten minutes, but then sometimes you say eight.	LeChuckFight.yack	248
BOYBRUSH	38542	One time I heard you say twelve. Which one is it?	LeChuckFight.yack	250
GUYBRUSH	38543	In my prime, I could do ten minutes, no problem.	LeChuckFight.yack	252
BOYBRUSH	38544	Are you in your prime in this story?	LeChuckFight.yack	255
GUYBRUSH	38545	Eight minutes.	LeChuckFight.yack	259

LECHUCK	31772	Procured by me at great expense and no small amount of trouble!	LeChucksCabin.dinky	22
LECHUCK	31773	So I'll not have you touching it, even with your eyeballs!	LeChucksCabin.dinky	23

LECHUCK	38706	{yelling}(yelling)Shouldn't ye be swabbing!	LeChucksCabin.dinky	173
HOVER	10937	I think I'll get out of here now	LeChucksCabin.dinky	218

HOVER	10939	What's this?	LeChucksCabin.dinky	249
HOVER	10940	I want this map	LeChucksCabin.dinky	249
HOVER	10941	I really want this	LeChucksCabin.dinky	249
GUYBRUSH	31776	It's not much of a “map.” There's just some writing on it, but clearly it's important.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	251
LECHUCK	31777	Don't even think about it, swabbie.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	257
HOVER	10942	Steal LeChuck's map	LeChucksCabin.dinky	265
GUYBRUSH	31778	Yes, but I'll want to do it in a way where LeChuck won't notice it's missing until it's too late.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	268
LECHUCK	31779	I don't like the way you're eyeing my map.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	274
HOVER	10943	Swap my mop tree map with LeChuck's map	LeChucksCabin.dinky	282
GUYBRUSH	31780	A map's a map. I don't think he'll spot the difference.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	285
GUYBRUSH	31781	Now I just need a unanimous vote from the crew. No problem.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	296
GUYBRUSH	31782	Now I just need to get Madison a skull, and we'll be good to go!	LeChucksCabin.dinky	298
LECHUCK	31783	I don't like the way you're eyeing my map.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	306
HOVER	10944	Swap this with LeChuck's map	LeChucksCabin.dinky	314
GUYBRUSH	31784	This isn't remotely like a map, he'd notice it right away.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	317
LECHUCK	31785	Keep yer eyes off that map, swabbie!	LeChucksCabin.dinky	327
HOVER	10945	That's my old mop tree map	LeChucksCabin.dinky	334
GUYBRUSH	31786	Hopefully he'll be fooled for long enough.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	336
GUYBRUSH	31787	And who knows, maybe he needs a new mop handle.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	336

HOVER	10947	What's this book?	LeChucksCabin.dinky	344
GUYBRUSH	31788	It's LeChuck's personal diary.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	346
GUYBRUSH	31789	I wouldn't have pegged him as the type for self-reflection.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	346

HOVER	10951	Feels like I've seen this before	LeChucksCabin.dinky	386
HOVER	10952	Consider the veil	LeChucksCabin.dinky	386
GUYBRUSH	31791	Wait a minute! That looks exactly like Elaine's wedding veil!	LeChucksCabin.dinky	389
GUYBRUSH	31792	I can't decide which is more disturbing: LeChuck somehow stealing Elaine's wedding veil, or, him having a copy made.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	391
HOVER	10953	Take the veil?	LeChucksCabin.dinky	395
GUYBRUSH	31793	If I'm wrong about what that is, taking it would be a big mistake. If I'm right, it would be a bigger one.	LeChucksCabin.dinky	399
HOVER	10954	Admire the art from a safe distance	LeChucksCabin.dinky	406

GUYBRUSH	31328	{see_elaine_up}Hi.	LimeGrove1.dinky	168
ELAINE	31329	Hi.	LimeGrove1.dinky	171
HOVER	10528	Look at all those limes	LimeGrove1.dinky	228
GUYBRUSH	31333	I hear these can help prevent scurvy.	LimeGrove1.dinky	233
ELAINE	31334	You heard right!	LimeGrove1.dinky	236
GUYBRUSH	31335	Elaine has enough limes for the entire known world.	LimeGrove1.dinky	240
HOVER	10529	Elaine said I could take some limes	LimeGrove1.dinky	243
HOVER	10530	Ask Elaine for some limes	LimeGrove1.dinky	243
HOVER	10538	Pick some limes	LimeGrove1.dinky	316
GUYBRUSH	31330	Wow, Elaine sure has been busy.	LimeGrove2.dinky	185
GUYBRUSH	31331	These groves go on forever!	LimeGrove2.dinky	186
GUYBRUSH	31332	Where do I find the mint groves?	LimeGrove2.dinky	187

HOVER	10536	Pick some limes	LimeGrove2.dinky	290
GUYBRUSH	31342	I'd better talk to Elaine before I steal any limes from the foundation she's worked so hard to set up.	LimeGrove2.dinky	294
GUYBRUSH	31343	Elaine has a bucketful that are already picked, that seems way easier.	LimeGrove2.dinky	297
GUYBRUSH	31344	I've already got plenty of limes.	LimeGrove2.dinky	299
HOVER	10539	Pick some limes	LimeGrove2.dinky	325

GUYBRUSH	31336	It's a torn painting of me. The other half is missing.	LimeGrove3.dinky	264
GUYBRUSH	31337	It's a torn painting of me.	LimeGrove3.dinky	266
HOVER	10532	Rescue this	LimeGrove3.dinky	270
GUYBRUSH	31338	This is torn from a portrait of Elaine and me.	LimeGrove3.dinky	273
HOVER	10535	Place my picture near the frame	LimeGrove3.dinky	276
HOVER	12430	What's behind the bird?	LimeGrove3.dinky	325
GUYBRUSH	40893	The bird has a torn picture in its nest.	LimeGrove3.dinky	329
GUYBRUSH	40894	Is that a picture of me?	LimeGrove3.dinky	330
HOVER	12431	Grab the picture	LimeGrove3.dinky	333
GUYBRUSH	40895	No way, I don't want to lose my hand.	LimeGrove3.dinky	337
HOVER	12432	Toss the bird some fish	LimeGrove3.dinky	340
HOVER	10541	Pick some limes	LimeGrove3.dinky	343

GUYBRUSH	40899	Agggh!	LimeGrove3.dinky	456
GUYBRUSH	40900	Agggh!	LimeGrove3.dinky	456
GUYBRUSH	40901	Whoah!	LimeGrove3.dinky	470
GUYBRUSH	40902	That bird needs an attitude adjustment.	LimeGrove3.dinky	471
GUYBRUSH	32160	Can you make me a key from this serial number?	Locksmith.dinky	18

HOVER	12199	Furnace baked crackers	Locksmith.dinky	135
HOVER	11210	Can I take some crackers now?	Locksmith.dinky	137
HOVER	11211	Are the crackers free?	Locksmith.dinky	137
GUYBRUSH	38744	They smell nice and toasty, but I've already got plenty of crackers.	Locksmith.dinky	143
GUYBRUSH	32169	{point}I'd really like some crackers.	Locksmith.dinky	148
GUYBRUSH	32170	{point}Are these for customers?	Locksmith.dinky	148
LOCKSMITH	32171	Not technically, but please help yourself.	Locksmith.dinky	152
LOCKSMITH	32172	That charming old guy who mans the lookout keeps bringing them for the parrot.	Locksmith.dinky	154
GUYBRUSH	32174	Thanks, I'll just take a few.	Locksmith.dinky	157
GUYBRUSH	32175	Thanks, I'll just take a few.	Locksmith.dinky	161
LOCKSMITH	32176	Hands off. Those are my last crackers.	Locksmith.dinky	164
HOVER	11214	Comment on the parrot	Locksmith.dinky	178
GUYBRUSH	32181	Handsome-looking parrot.	Locksmith.dinky	182
LOCKSMITH	32182	And also vicious. But it was my mother's favorite.	Locksmith.dinky	185
HOVER	11215	Offer a cracker to the parrot	Locksmith.dinky	192
GUYBRUSH	32183	It already looks well fed.	Locksmith.dinky	195
HOVER	11216	Cool machine!	Locksmith.dinky	203
GUYBRUSH	32184	{point}That's an impressive machine.	Locksmith.dinky	208
LOCKSMITH	32185	Yep! This wouldn't be much of a lock shop without a key grinder.	Locksmith.dinky	211
HOVER	11217	Beg to try the key grinder	Locksmith.dinky	217
HOVER	11218	Ask to try the key grinder	Locksmith.dinky	217
GUYBRUSH	32186	Can I try out your key grinder?	Locksmith.dinky	223
LOCKSMITH	32187	{stop_hand}Ha! No. I wouldn't want you to lose any fingers.	Locksmith.dinky	226
GUYBRUSH	32188	Come on, can I PLEASE try your key grinder?	Locksmith.dinky	228
LOCKSMITH	32189	Seriously, I don't much care if you grind off a finger, but I don't want to have to clean up afterwards.	Locksmith.dinky	231
HOVER	11219	Ask about the keys	Locksmith.dinky	242
GUYBRUSH	32190	{point_down45}What's this key?	Locksmith.dinky	247
GUYBRUSH	32191	{point_down45}What's that key?	Locksmith.dinky	249
LOCKSMITH	32192	That's for a lockable quiver.	Locksmith.dinky	253
LOCKSMITH	32193	That one is only for going in, never for coming out.	Locksmith.dinky	254
LOCKSMITH	32194	That one's for making a quick exit from somewhere you're trapped.	Locksmith.dinky	255
LOCKSMITH	32195	That opens a long, straight wardrobe for keeping long, straight dresses.	Locksmith.dinky	256
LOCKSMITH	32196	That activates a mechanical kettle.	Locksmith.dinky	257
LOCKSMITH	32197	That unlocks your house.	Locksmith.dinky	258
LOCKSMITH	32198	And please don't touch the glass.	Locksmith.dinky	262
HOVER	11220	Elegant book	Locksmith.dinky	272

HOVER	11221	Clever nested boxes	Locksmith.dinky	289
GUYBRUSH	32201	These are nice.	Locksmith.dinky	293
LOCKSMITH	32202	Thanks.	Locksmith.dinky	297
LOCKSMITH	32203	It's a locksmithing test.	Locksmith.dinky	301
GUYBRUSH	32204	Close it all up, and if you get the key out, you pass?	Locksmith.dinky	303
LOCKSMITH	32205	That's the beginner level, yes.	Locksmith.dinky	305
LOCKSMITH	32206	The real challenge is to lock the larger box inside the smaller one.	Locksmith.dinky	307
HOVER	11226	Ask about the locks	Locksmith.dinky	321
GUYBRUSH	32217	{point_down45}What's this lock?	Locksmith.dinky	326
GUYBRUSH	32218	{point_down45}What's that lock?	Locksmith.dinky	328
LOCKSMITH	32219	That's for hats.	Locksmith.dinky	332
LOCKSMITH	32220	It's meant for bachelors to secure their apartments.	Locksmith.dinky	333
LOCKSMITH	32221	A special one that can open with any of four different keys.	Locksmith.dinky	334
LOCKSMITH	32222	A famous lawyer used that to keep people from stealing his front door mat.	Locksmith.dinky	335
LOCKSMITH	32223	That's for sealing a container full of evaporated gas.	Locksmith.dinky	336
LOCKSMITH	32224	It's for a small jazz band to lock up their gear.	Locksmith.dinky	337
LOCKSMITH	32225	And please don't touch the glass.	Locksmith.dinky	341
HOVER	12270	Ask about the poster	Locksmith.dinky	353
HOVER	12271	Ask about the Golden Keys	Locksmith.dinky	354
HOVER	12272	Fantasize about having all of the Golden Keys	Locksmith.dinky	355
GUYBRUSH	39576	(to self)You will be mine, Golden Keys.	Locksmith.dinky	359
GUYBRUSH	39988	{point}Is that from a famous locksmith band or something?	Locksmith.dinky	366
LOCKSMITH	39989	My mother's band, “The Golden Keys.”	Locksmith.dinky	369
LOCKSMITH	39990	They were named after some actual Golden Keys that she spent a bunch of time looking for.	Locksmith.dinky	371
GUYBRUSH	39580	Are those the Golden Keys?	Locksmith.dinky	372
LOCKSMITH	39581	That's right. Years ago my mother used to hunt for them.	Locksmith.dinky	375
GUYBRUSH	39582	{point}What more can you tell me about the Golden Keys?	Locksmith.dinky	378
LOCKSMITH	39583	Not much. I was just a kid, and mysteries have never been my thing. Too messy.	Locksmith.dinky	381
HOVER	11229	What's this map again?	Locksmith.dinky	392
HOVER	11230	Is this a treasure map?	Locksmith.dinky	392
GUYBRUSH	32230	I see a peninsula trailing off into small islands, but no “X marks the spot.”	Locksmith.dinky	396
LOCKSMITH	32231	It's southern Florida. I have family there.	Locksmith.dinky	399
HOVER	11238	Make a pun about the painting	Locksmith.dinky	416
GUYBRUSH	32245	I see everyone in that portrait has lovely “locks.”	Locksmith.dinky	420
LOCKSMITH	32246	If you have to make a pun, at least make a good one.	Locksmith.dinky	423
HOVER	11239	Buy the fishing lure	Locksmith.dinky	434
HOVER	11240	What's that?	Locksmith.dinky	434
GUYBRUSH	32247	What is that? It's definitely not a key. Or a lock.	Locksmith.dinky	440
LOCKSMITH	32248	It's a fishing lure, of course.	Locksmith.dinky	443
GUYBRUSH	32249	Of course.	Locksmith.dinky	446
GUYBRUSH	32250	How much for the fishing lure?	Locksmith.dinky	451
LOCKSMITH	32251	It's not for sale. This is a locksmith's shop. Perhaps you saw the sign outside.	Locksmith.dinky	454
HOVER	11241	It's a Chums lure!	Locksmith.dinky	461
HOVER	11242	Is she in the Chums?	Locksmith.dinky	461
GUYBRUSH	32252	Are you in the Chums?	Locksmith.dinky	467
LOCKSMITH	32253	If I were, would I tell you?	Locksmith.dinky	470
GUYBRUSH	32254	Hey, fellow Chum.	Locksmith.dinky	473
LOCKSMITH	32255	You know I can only talk Chums business if you show your lure. It's tradition!	Locksmith.dinky	476
HOVER	11243	Show my lure	Locksmith.dinky	483
HOVER	11244	Talk with Locke Smith	Locksmith.dinky	495
HOVER	11245	Talk to the locksmith	Locksmith.dinky	495
HOVER	11246	Offer cracker mix to Locke Smith	Locksmith.dinky	500
GUYBRUSH	32256	I found some cracker mix. You could bake fresh crackers in your furnace!	Locksmith.dinky	507
GUYBRUSH	32257	I see you have a parrot and only a few crackers. Would you like some cracker mix?	Locksmith.dinky	509
LOCKSMITH	32258	Thanks.	Locksmith.dinky	513
LOCKSMITH	32259	The ones on the plate were getting a bit stale. Take some if you want.	Locksmith.dinky	516
GUYBRUSH	32260	Don't mind if I do!	Locksmith.dinky	518
HOVER	12201	Ask if she knows about the lock this was covering	Locksmith.dinky	527
GUYBRUSH	38746	I found a sign that says “XYZZY,” covering the lock on a gate on Terror Island.	Locksmith.dinky	532
GUYBRUSH	38747	Would you know anything about that?	Locksmith.dinky	534
LOCKSMITH	38748	I remember when I was a little girl my parents did some work for a guy who was sealing up a cave there.	Locksmith.dinky	536
LOCKSMITH	38749	But he went to Terror Island and never came back.	Locksmith.dinky	538
HOVER	12257	Settle accounts	Locksmith.dinky	542
GUYBRUSH	39510	Do I owe you anything at the moment?	Locksmith.dinky	547
LOCKSMITH	39511	Thank you for noticing.	Locksmith.dinky	552
GUYBRUSH	39512	This should cover it.	Locksmith.dinky	557
LOCKSMITH	39513	Thanks.	Locksmith.dinky	559
LOCKSMITH	39514	No.	Locksmith.dinky	562
GUYBRUSH	35224	{point_self}I'm Guybrush Threepwood.	Locksmith.yack	24
LOCKSMITH	35225	Pleased to meet you, I'm Locke Smith.	Locksmith.yack	25
GUYBRUSH	35226	You're kidding, right?	Locksmith.yack	26
LOCKSMITH	35227	Nope.	Locksmith.yack	27
LOCKSMITH	35228	{stop_hand}And before you ask: Yes they did, yes it was, and they really, really wanted me to follow in the family business.	Locksmith.yack	28
TEXT	20341	Locke Smith	Locksmith.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	35229	Hello again.	Locksmith.yack	34
GUYBRUSH	35230	It's really clean in here. Do you have a mop I could use?	Locksmith.yack	39
LOCKSMITH	35231	I simply don't allow filth to accumulate in the first place.	Locksmith.yack	40
LOCKSMITH	35232	Try somewhere a little less sanitary. Like the bar by the docks.	Locksmith.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	35233	Can I get another key made?	Locksmith.yack	43
LOCKSMITH	35234	Sure, just write down the serial number and give it to me.	Locksmith.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	35235	Can you really make keys for stuff? That seems like a magic trick.	Locksmith.yack	46
LOCKSMITH	35236	Modern locks have serial numbers that tell me all I need to know. No tricks necessary, just information.	Locksmith.yack	48
GUYBRUSH	35237	It seems wrong that you can make a key from just the serial number.	Locksmith.yack	50
LOCKSMITH	35238	It's a failsafe. In case people lose their key. You know how people are.	Locksmith.yack	51
GUYBRUSH	35239	Aren't locks way less secure if all you need is a number to get a new key?	Locksmith.yack	53
LOCKSMITH	35240	That's why you should never share the serial number with anyone.	Locksmith.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	35241	What happens if you lose your key and the serial number at the same time?	Locksmith.yack	56
LOCKSMITH	35242	The numbers are usually engraved on the locks, just in case.	Locksmith.yack	57
LOCKSMITH	35243	And if you lose the lock, chances are you don't need a new key.	Locksmith.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	35244	{thinking}What's to stop me reading the serial number on someone else's lock and having a key made?	Locksmith.yack	60
LOCKSMITH	35245	The numbers are printed small enough that you need a special tool to read them.	Locksmith.yack	61
LOCKSMITH	35246	Only a pro would have a tool like that.	Locksmith.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	35247	Can I borrow your lock-serial-number-reading tool?	Locksmith.yack	64
LOCKSMITH	35248	My magnifier? Not a chance. I could be drummed out of the union for that.	Locksmith.yack	65
LOCKSMITH	35249	{stop_hand}If you want to play locksmith, you'll have to look elsewhere.	Locksmith.yack	66
GUYBRUSH	35250	Tell me again about how to have keys made, it's exciting.	Locksmith.yack	68
LOCKSMITH	35251	You bring me the serial number from the lock, I make the key.	Locksmith.yack	69
LOCKSMITH	35252	It's pretty straightforward.	Locksmith.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	35253	Who's the old lady in the window across the way?	Locksmith.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	35254	How well do you know Widey Bones?	Locksmith.yack	73
LOCKSMITH	35255	Not well at all, but she's been living near my shop quite a few years.	Locksmith.yack	74
LOCKSMITH	35256	She was across from my old location, too.	Locksmith.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	35257	She moved when you moved?	Locksmith.yack	76
LOCKSMITH	35258	I'm sure it's just a coincidence.	Locksmith.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	35259	Would your mother perhaps have been known as “Old Mrs. Smith”?	Locksmith.yack	79
GUYBRUSH	35260	Widey Bones said something about an “Old Mrs. Smith.”	Locksmith.yack	81
LOCKSMITH	35261	Well I didn't call her that, but I suppose some people did.	Locksmith.yack	82
LOCKSMITH	35262	Mainly when she was older.	Locksmith.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	35263	Have you heard of “The Golden Keys”?	Locksmith.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	39606	Did your mother find any of those Golden Keys she was looking for?	Locksmith.yack	87
GUYBRUSH	35264	{see_elaine}I will pay you any amount of money you like for your mother's key!!	Locksmith.yack	89
GUYBRUSH	35265	{see_elaine}I will pay you any amount of money you like for your mother's key!!	Locksmith.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	35266	What happened to your mother's Golden Key?	Locksmith.yack	91
LOCKSMITH	35267	As you can see from the letter I gave you, the court destroyed the key.	Locksmith.yack	92
GUYBRUSH	35268	{proud}I'm on a quest to find The Secret of Monkey Island!	Locksmith.yack	94
GUYBRUSH	35269	How would you like to join a pirate crew?	Locksmith.yack	95
LOCKSMITH	35270	Would I have to leave my shop?	Locksmith.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	35271	Well yes, that's the general idea. The crew actually get on the ship, and, you know. Crew it.	Locksmith.yack	98
LOCKSMITH	35272	Thanks, I'll pass.	Locksmith.yack	99
LOCKSMITH	39009	Try down at the docks, there's always somebody hiring somebody down there.	Locksmith.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	35273	I think I'll browse around a bit.	Locksmith.yack	102
LOCKSMITH	35274	{stop_hand}Try not to touch anything.	Locksmith.yack	103
LOCKSMITH	35275	I've got a system and I don't like it disrupted.	Locksmith.yack	104
LOCKSMITH	35276	Sure. My mother had one of them.	Locksmith.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	35277	“Had?”	Locksmith.yack	111
LOCKSMITH	35278	She left it to me in her will.	Locksmith.yack	112
LOCKSMITH	39607	One. She left it to me in her will.	Locksmith.yack	118
TEXT	20481	Widey Bones	Locksmith.yack	125
LOCKSMITH	35279	You mean Widey Bones. She used to be the undertaker here, years ago.	Locksmith.yack	127
LOCKSMITH	35280	Seems to know a lot of things that maybe don't quite fit together.	Locksmith.yack	128
LOCKSMITH	35281	Exciting!	Locksmith.yack	134
LOCKSMITH	35282	The story in my family is that The Secret is sort of like a key. One that opens all locks at once.	Locksmith.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	35283	All at once? How does that work?	Locksmith.yack	136
LOCKSMITH	35284	No idea, it's just a story. But I guess you'll find out soon enough!	Locksmith.yack	137
GUYBRUSH	35285	That seems enormously useful.	Locksmith.yack	138
LOCKSMITH	35286	Maybe. Depends on if you can close them again.	Locksmith.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	35287	If it is a key, could you duplicate it?	Locksmith.yack	140
LOCKSMITH	35288	I'm not sure you're supposed to take it literally.	Locksmith.yack	141
LOCKSMITH	35289	That old thing? Really?	Locksmith.yack	146
GUYBRUSH	35290	{happy}I'll give you a hundred thousand pieces of eight.	Locksmith.yack	148
LOCKSMITH	35291	You don't look like you have that kind of money.	Locksmith.yack	149
GUYBRUSH	35292	{point_up}I'll trade you a ship. The Sea Monkey II, it's a gem.	Locksmith.yack	150
LOCKSMITH	35293	I'm sure it is.	Locksmith.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	35294	{point_up}I'll cut you in for a twenty percent share of The Secret of Monkey Island.	Locksmith.yack	152
LOCKSMITH	35295	I'm not even sure how that would work.	Locksmith.yack	153
GUYBRUSH	35296	{point_up}Would you consider my first-born child in exchange?	Locksmith.yack	154
LOCKSMITH	35297	Listen, if it means that much to you, just take it.	Locksmith.yack	157
GUYBRUSH	35298	Yes!	Locksmith.yack	159
GUYBRUSH	35299	That was surprisingly easy and uncomplicated.	Locksmith.yack	176
LOCKSMITH	35300	Don't get used to it. Life's not like that very often.	Locksmith.yack	177
LOCKSMITH	35301	When my mother died her personal possessions went into probate with the court.	Locksmith.yack	182
LOCKSMITH	35302	When they came out of probate I was still too devastated to claim them.	Locksmith.yack	183
LOCKSMITH	35303	As you can see from this letter the court sent, they and the key have been destroyed.	Locksmith.yack	184
GUYBRUSH	35304	Well, this is an unexpected wrinkle.	Locksmith.yack	193
BOYBRUSH	35305	What?!	Locksmith.yack	201
GUYBRUSH	35306	It's just a figure of speech.	Locksmith.yack	203

HOVER	11185	Head down to the docks	Lookout.dinky	176
HOVER	11186	Cute little guy	Lookout.dinky	190
HOVER	11187	It's like a mini-lookout	Lookout.dinky	190
GUYBRUSH	32141	Hi there little guy.	Lookout.dinky	195
LOOKOUT	32142	Hi.	Lookout.dinky	201
GUYBRUSH	32143	I detect a certain resemblance here.	Lookout.dinky	209
LOOKOUT	32144	Yes, it looks a lot like an owl, doesn't it?	Lookout.dinky	213
GUYBRUSH	32145	Hi there little guy.	Lookout.dinky	219
HOVER	11188	Check out the firewood	Lookout.dinky	235
GUYBRUSH	32146	It's nicely dried, pre-cut, and ready to go.	Lookout.dinky	237
HOVER	11189	Borrow some firewood	Lookout.dinky	240
GUYBRUSH	32147	I think I'll fill up my coat pockets with this bulky firewood. It seems like it might come in handy somewhere, and I'm sure no one will miss it.	Lookout.dinky	243
GUYBRUSH	40853	Ah... Feels good to be back on Mêlée Island.	Lookout.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	40854	{proud}The hub of pirating in the Caribbean!	Lookout.yack	36
GUYBRUSH	33398	I'll see some old pals and get things rolling! Or, sailing, in this case.	Lookout.yack	36
GUYBRUSH	40855	Where every good expedition begins.	Lookout.yack	37
GUYBRUSH	33399	Hi!	Lookout.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	33400	{point_self}I'm Guybrush Threepwood. Remember me?	Lookout.yack	55
LOOKOUT	33401	Of course!	Lookout.yack	57
LOOKOUT	33402	We lookouts have a lot of discretionary thinking time.	Lookout.yack	58
LOOKOUT	33403	I use mine to revisit my memories of every Anne, Jack and Guybrush who spent five seconds with me a decade ago on their way to someplace else.	Lookout.yack	59
GUYBRUSH	33404	{confused}Um, wow...	Lookout.yack	60
LOOKOUT	33405	Relax, I'm just winding your anchor chain.	Lookout.yack	61
LOOKOUT	33406	Haven't seen you in a while, Threepwood. What've you been up to?	Lookout.yack	63
GUYBRUSH	33407	{question}Oh, you know. Freebooting mostly. Swashing buckles and so on.	Lookout.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	33408	But now I'm getting an expedition together, to find The Secret of Monkey Island!	Lookout.yack	65
LOOKOUT	33409	Oh, you're sailing with LeChuck!	Lookout.yack	69
GUYBRUSH	33410	{surprised}What?! LeChuck's here in Mêlée?	Lookout.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	33411	Is there widespread panic? Are people evacuating?	Lookout.yack	71
LOOKOUT	33412	He doesn't seem interested in carnage at the moment. Ship's just here taking on supplies and crew as far as I can tell.	Lookout.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	33413	{angry}Well anyway, no, I am not sailing with LeChuck!	Lookout.yack	73
GUYBRUSH	33414	You know my history with him.	Lookout.yack	74
GUYBRUSH	33415	[silent]LeChuck kidnapped my wife!	Lookout.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	33416	{point_hard}LeChuck kidnapped my wife! He's always had designs on her!	Lookout.yack	78
GUYBRUSH	33417	{explain_angry}I sailed to Monkey Island to find them and get her back!	Lookout.yack	79
LOOKOUT	33418	I thought you weren't married yet when that happened. And didn't she more or less rescue herself?	Lookout.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	33419	{angry}That's not the point!	Lookout.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	33420	[silent]He's an evil zombie ghost pirate, terror of the seas!	Lookout.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	33421	{point_hard}He's an evil zombie ghost pirate, terror of the seas and sometimes the land!	Lookout.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	33422	{explain_angry}A nefarious, conniving, murdering scallywag!	Lookout.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	33423	{point_hard_down}A depraved, ruthless villain! And a loud talker!	Lookout.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	33424	{defiant}And I'm... not those things!	Lookout.yack	87
LOOKOUT	33425	They say opposites attract, but what do I know?	Lookout.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	33426	[silent]We've been enemies for my whole career!	Lookout.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	33427	We've been enemies for my whole career!	Lookout.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	33428	{handsup}Everywhere I go, there he is! He plagues me! He's my nemesis!	Lookout.yack	92
LOOKOUT	33429	Funny, he said the same thing about you.	Lookout.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	33430	{point_hard_down}That guy steals all my best ideas.	Lookout.yack	95
LOOKOUT	33431	You sure it isn't the other way around? Seems like he was here first.	Lookout.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	33432	{shrug}I don't know how he found out, but I'm sure he's just doing this to get one up on me.	Lookout.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	33433	[silent]I'm mounting my own voyage. Mine.	Lookout.yack	99
GUYBRUSH	33434	{point_self}I'm mounting my own voyage. Mine.	Lookout.yack	102
LOOKOUT	33435	Well, you'd better get cracking, then. LeChuck's loading up on the outer dock as we speak.	Lookout.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	33436	{proud}Well I'm going to hire a ship and a crew and beat him to the punch!	Lookout.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	33437	Just as soon as I can get someone to back the venture.	Lookout.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	33438	{thinking}I'm a little short on funds at the moment.	Lookout.yack	108
LOOKOUT	33439	In that case, you'll want to go talk to the pirate leaders at the Scumm Bar.	Lookout.yack	109
GUYBRUSH	33440	{point}Exactly, that's why I came to Mêlée!	Lookout.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	33441	{happy}It'll be great to see those old guys again.	Lookout.yack	111
GUYBRUSH	33442	{happy}We'll knock back a grog and hash out the details.	Lookout.yack	112
LOOKOUT	33443	Scumm Bar. By the docks.	Lookout.yack	113
LOOKOUT	33444	Long table in the back.	Lookout.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	33445	I know where I'm going.	Lookout.yack	115
LOOKOUT	33446	We'll see.	Lookout.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	33447	Hi again.	Lookout.yack	129
LOOKOUT	33448	Shouldn't you be on your way to the Scumm Bar, to talk to the pirate leaders?	Lookout.yack	136
GUYBRUSH	33449	I was just about to head down there.	Lookout.yack	137
GUYBRUSH	33450	Those new pirate leaders are real jerks!	Lookout.yack	143
GUYBRUSH	33451	They laughed at me! And they won't fund my expedition!	Lookout.yack	144
GUYBRUSH	33452	Why didn't you warn me?	Lookout.yack	145
LOOKOUT	33453	Would you have listened?	Lookout.yack	147
GUYBRUSH	33454	Of course!	Lookout.yack	148
GUYBRUSH	33455	Okay, no, probably not.	Lookout.yack	149
GUYBRUSH	33456	Has LeChuck's ship set sail yet?	Lookout.yack	155
LOOKOUT	33457	Nope. Still at the dock.	Lookout.yack	157
GUYBRUSH	33458	I'm thinking about going on LeChuck's expedition after all.	Lookout.yack	163
LOOKOUT	33459	Glad to hear you decided to patch things up.	Lookout.yack	165
GUYBRUSH	33460	He doesn't want me on the ship, I'm blacklisted. I'm going to have to go in disguise.	Lookout.yack	166
LOOKOUT	33461	These Shakespearean comedies just write themselves.	Lookout.yack	167
GUYBRUSH	33466	See anything interesting out there?	Lookout.yack	173
LOOKOUT	33467	Change. The Future.	Lookout.yack	175
GUYBRUSH	33468	(craning to look)Are those the names of ships? All I can see is open water.	Lookout.yack	176
LOOKOUT	33469	It's what I named my cataracts.	Lookout.yack	177
GUYBRUSH	33470	Ah.	Lookout.yack	178
GUYBRUSH	33471	You've been at this post a long time.	Lookout.yack	183
LOOKOUT	33472	Yep.	Lookout.yack	185
LOOKOUT	33473	My eyesight isn't what it once was. But my hearing is still as sharp as the governor's sword!	Lookout.yack	186
GUYBRUSH	33474	And... that's helpful for being a lookout?	Lookout.yack	187
LOOKOUT	33475	There's hardly ever anything to see anyway, the job is mostly about greeting people.	Lookout.yack	188
LOOKOUT	33476	Welcome to Mêlée Island!	Lookout.yack	189
GUYBRUSH	33477	Thanks.	Lookout.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	33478	Ever think about retiring?	Lookout.yack	195
LOOKOUT	33479	Sure, sounds great.	Lookout.yack	197
LOOKOUT	33480	I'll get a little place where I can sit by the fire and watch the ocean.	Lookout.yack	198		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33481	Say...	Lookout.yack	202
LOOKOUT	33482	You'll have to excuse me, I think I see something on the horizon.	Lookout.yack	204
GUYBRUSH	33483	You're waiting for earthquake relief?	Lookout.yack	217
LOOKOUT	33484	Waiting for. Not expecting.	Lookout.yack	219
GUYBRUSH	33485	What are you all waiting for?	Lookout.yack	222
LOOKOUT	33486	Earthquake relief!	Lookout.yack	224
LOOKOUT	33487	And you'd better not be looking to jump the line!	Lookout.yack	226
GUYBRUSH	33488	I wouldn't dream of it.	Lookout.yack	227
LOOKOUT	33489	Those who cut, get cut.	Lookout.yack	228
GUYBRUSH	33490	Who's manning the lookout if you're here in line?	Lookout.yack	233
LOOKOUT	33491	You want to do it? Feel free.	Lookout.yack	235
GUYBRUSH	33492	How long do you plan to wait here?	Lookout.yack	239
LOOKOUT	33493	As long as it takes.	Lookout.yack	240
GUYBRUSH	38219	Aye, Cobb.	Loom.yack	21
GUYBRUSH	38220	Hard to believe after all these years, you're still here.	Loom.yack	24
COBB	38221	I was declared a historical landmark.	Loom.yack	26
COBB	38222	You again! I know you...	Loom.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	38223	The place does seem different from what I remember.	Loom.yack	33
COBB	38224	It's this new younger generation of pirate leaders.	Loom.yack	34
COBB	38225	All their highfalutin Dark Magic.	Loom.yack	35
COBB	38226	(mocking)“Look at us, we're so much better than you because we don't drink grog before getting married.”	Loom.yack	36
COBB	38227	These kids today are all about sacking and pillaging. They've got no heart.	Loom.yack	37
GUYBRUSH	38228	I'm going to find The Secret of Monkey Island! Wanna come?	Loom.yack	39
GUYBRUSH	38229	Tell me about Loom.	Loom.yack	41
COBB	38230	I'm so sick of pirates asking me about Loom.	Loom.yack	42
COBB	38231	Get lost.	Loom.yack	43
GUYBRUSH	38232	Then why don't you take off the “Ask Me About Loom” button?	Loom.yack	45
COBB	38233	My grog-riddled body has fused with it.	Loom.yack	46
COBB	38234	I'm more button than man at this point.	Loom.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	38235	Oh, come on. Tell me about Loom. For old times' sake.	Loom.yack	49
COBB	38236	Beat it!	Loom.yack	50
GUYBRUSH	38237	Say it!	Loom.yack	52
COBB	38238	No!	Loom.yack	53
GUYBRUSH	38239	Saaayyyy it!	Loom.yack	55
GUYBRUSH	38240	Nice talking to you.	Loom.yack	57
COBB	38241	Yeah, yeah.	Loom.yack	58
COBB	38242	You going to point the way there with your mop? Some pirate you are.	Loom.yack	64
COBB	38243	I heard The Secret is just some marketing gimmick Stan thought up.	Loom.yack	68
COBB	38244	That only the gullible and naive would go looking for it.	Loom.yack	69
COBB	38245	No.	Loom.yack	71
COBB	38246	And I'll order a new one! GROG!	Loom.yack	76
GUYBRUSH	38247	Aye?	Loom.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	38248	He's probably drunk on good storytelling.	Loom.yack	82
COBB	38249	Fine...	Loom.yack	87
COBB	38250	You mean the latest masterpiece of fantasy storytelling from Lucasfilm's Brian Moriarty?	Loom.yack	90
COBB	38251	Why it's an extraordinary adventure with an interface of magic.	Loom.yack	91
COBB	38252	Stunning, high-resolution, 3D landscapes, sophisticated score and musical effects.	Loom.yack	92
COBB	38253	Not to mention the detailed animation and special effects, elegant point 'n' click control of characters, objects, and magic spells.	Loom.yack	93
COBB	38254	But wait, there's more!	Loom.yack	96
TEXT	20342	<ADVERTISEMENT>	Loom.yack	97
COBB	38255	Loom™ has no burdensome typing, mapping, or inventory management.	Loom.yack	98
COBB	38256	And unlike many adventure games today, it's easy for beginners to enjoy.	Loom.yack	99
COBB	38257	A leading game magazine says it's, 'Enchanting, complex, captivating.'	Loom.yack	100
COBB	38258	Beat the rush!	Loom.yack	103
COBB	38259	Go out and buy Loom today!	Loom.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	38260	{fist_pump}Yes!	Loom.yack	107
COBB	38261	Now get lost!	Loom.yack	108

HOVER	11093	Oh no!	LowStreet.dinky	324

GUYBRUSH	31974	Someone defaced Elaine's scurvy flyer!	LowStreet.dinky	329
HOVER	11094	Take the flyer	LowStreet.dinky	333
GUYBRUSH	31975	Elaine would kill me if she caught me pulling down her flyers.	LowStreet.dinky	338
GUYBRUSH	31976	Nah, it's unreadable now. Though, in some ways that could be considered an improvement.	LowStreet.dinky	340
HOVER	11095	Replace the flyer	LowStreet.dinky	343
GUYBRUSH	31977	It's a nice idea, but I might still need this.	LowStreet.dinky	347

HOVER	11100	Free?	LowStreet.dinky	385
GUYBRUSH	31980	They're having a half-off sale!	LowStreet.dinky	388
GUYBRUSH	31981	Free is even better than half-off!	LowStreet.dinky	390
GUYBRUSH	31982	Halfway better!	LowStreet.dinky	390
HOVER	11101	How reassuring	LowStreet.dinky	398
GUYBRUSH	31983	The voodoo here must be authentic, culturally and historically accurate. The sign says so.	LowStreet.dinky	400

GUYBRUSH	32649	Another resource has given its all in support of my personal goals.	MopTreeDestroyed.dinky	123
GUYBRUSH	32650	It's what nature is for!	MopTreeDestroyed.dinky	123
HOVER	12216	Tiny deer	MopTreeDestroyed.dinky	128

GUYBRUSH	38795	I must have startled them while I was whittling. Some animals are quite skittish.	MopTreeDestroyed.dinky	144
MURRAY	36229	Bwahahaha!	Murray.yack	45
GUYBRUSH	36230	Murray?	Murray.yack	46
MURRAY	36231	Indeed, I am Murray, the all-powerful demonic skull.	Murray.yack	47
MURRAY	36232	But you have me at a disadvantage, withered zombie man. Have we met before?	Murray.yack	48
GUYBRUSH	36233	Oops.	Murray.yack	50
MURRAY	36234	Oops is right!	Murray.yack	51
MURRAY	36235	You shouldn't go opening crates without knocking first!	Murray.yack	52
GUYBRUSH	36236	No, but I'm a big fan.	Murray.yack	53
MURRAY	36237	Ah, my reputation precedes me, like the locusts before the storm!	Murray.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	36238	Locusts?	Murray.yack	55
MURRAY	36239	But I will sign no autographs!	Murray.yack	56
GUYBRUSH	36240	Yes, at a demonic skull party.	Murray.yack	57
MURRAY	36241	I recall a clumsy bartender spilling a Lava Guavatini on my necktie, that must have been you.	Murray.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	36242	Necktie?	Murray.yack	59
MURRAY	36243	And you plague me now just as before!	Murray.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	36244	I'm in disguise.	Murray.yack	61
MURRAY	36245	In that case I would think you'd comprehend the value of staying hidden!	Murray.yack	62
MURRAY	36246	A curse of painful boils on your left foot for exposing me!	Murray.yack	80
MURRAY	36247	I'm here undercover, gathering valuable information for the exquisitely devious Captain Madison!	Murray.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	36248	{thinking}Madison? Very interesting.	Murray.yack	82
MURRAY	36249	Oo, I probably should not have said that.	Murray.yack	83
MURRAY	36250	Do me a favor and keep it to yourself, Withered Zombie Man.	Murray.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	36251	No problem.	Murray.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	36252	How come you're working for Captain Madison? I thought you were your own man... er, skull.	Murray.yack	106
MURRAY	36253	I... owe her a favor. It's none of your business.	Murray.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	36254	Why do you owe Captain Madison a favor?	Murray.yack	112
MURRAY	36255	Well, ironically I was sealed up in a crate, and she freed me.	Murray.yack	113
GUYBRUSH	36256	You mean like I just did?	Murray.yack	114
MURRAY	36257	It's not the same thing!	Murray.yack	115
GUYBRUSH	36258	What exactly is Madison up to?	Murray.yack	120
MURRAY	36259	I would be a poor spy indeed if I told you that!	Murray.yack	121
GUYBRUSH	36260	Come on, tell me what Madison is up to.	Murray.yack	123
MURRAY	36261	You diminish us both by asking. Knock it off.	Murray.yack	125
GUYBRUSH	36263	I really think you should come with me.	Murray.yack	130
MURRAY	36264	No.	Murray.yack	131
GUYBRUSH	36265	{wistful}Please?	Murray.yack	133
MURRAY	36266	Spare me your dull entreaties, I cannot be moved.	Murray.yack	134
MURRAY	36267	Figuratively speaking.	Murray.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	36268	{point_up}I can get you close to LeChuck.	Murray.yack	137
MURRAY	36269	(mulling)Hmm...	Murray.yack	139
MURRAY	36270	I would very much like to be able to spy on LeChuck himself!	Murray.yack	140
MURRAY	36271	Bwahahaha!	Murray.yack	141
MURRAY	36272	Very well. You may transport me.	Murray.yack	142
GUYBRUSH	36273	{shrug}You won't learn much here in the hold.	Murray.yack	152
MURRAY	36274	Wrong! The hold is a treasure trove of information!	Murray.yack	153
MURRAY	36275	The nature of the cargo! The state of the hull!	Murray.yack	154
MURRAY	36276	The battle-ready chickens and slow-witted zombies!	Murray.yack	155
GUYBRUSH	36277	{upset}Hey!	Murray.yack	156
MURRAY	36278	I've got a lot of important spying to do down here. Leave me to it.	Murray.yack	157
GUYBRUSH	36279	Fine, never mind.	Murray.yack	159
MURRAY	36280	None shall surmount my staggering will.	Murray.yack	160
MURRAY	36281	Especially not you.	Murray.yack	161
GUYBRUSH	36282	How's it going in there, Murray?	Murray.yack	167
MURRAY	36283	I didn't realize how hard it would be to see anything from your pocket. Good thing I have excellent hearing.	Murray.yack	169
MURRAY	36284	You'll pay for this indignity, you worthless skullnapper!	Murray.yack	171
GUYBRUSH	36285	Let me apologize in advance.	Murray.yack	183
GUYBRUSH	36286	You're going to have to take one for the team.	Murray.yack	184
MURRAY	36287	I see no team! Only you, Withered Zombie Man.	Murray.yack	187
MURRAY	36288	Let me assure you that whatever you're planning, it will be nothing compared to the torments that I will...	Murray.yack	188
MURRAY	39281	Aaahh!	Murray.yack	189
MURRAY	36289	Hm.	Murray.yack	210
MURRAY	36290	The headache from my old cannon injury is gone.	Murray.yack	211
GUYBRUSH	36291	Oh good!	Murray.yack	216
MURRAY	36292	And replaced with a brand new, even more excruciating one.	Murray.yack	221
MURRAY	36293	I would admire your methods if they had been used on someone else.	Murray.yack	223
GUYBRUSH	36294	Thanks, I guess.	Murray.yack	228
GUYBRUSH	36295	How's it going in there, Murray?	Murray.yack	237
MURRAY	36296	I don't want to talk to you right now, except to say that exquisite punishments await you at your final resting place.	Murray.yack	238
GUYBRUSH	36297	Nice to see you're okay, Murray.	Murray.yack	244
MURRAY	36298	No thanks to you!	Murray.yack	245
MURRAY	36299	This morning the day was like a treasure chest, filled with promise, intrigue, and excitement!	Murray.yack	246
MURRAY	36300	You have filled that chest with indignities!	Murray.yack	247
MURRAY	36301	It weighs upon me like a mountain of lead.	Murray.yack	248
GUYBRUSH	36302	Good thing you're already flat, then.	Murray.yack	249
MURRAY	36303	Stop talking to me now, Withered Zombie Man.	Murray.yack	250
GUYBRUSH	36304	Can I apologize to you?	Murray.yack	254
MURRAY	36305	When you are writhing upon the sizzling coals of revenge while I cackle with glee, then, you may apologize.	Murray.yack	255
GUYBRUSH	36306	Later, then.	Murray.yack	256
GUYBRUSH	36307	How's it going in there, Murray?	Murray.yack	260
MURRAY	36308	I don't know what you're planning now but I'm going to see you burn for it.	Murray.yack	261
MURRAY	36309	Threepwood! I might have known you'd be wrapped up in this, it's just your kind of swamp!	Murray.yack	267
GUYBRUSH	36310	Yours too, it seems.	Murray.yack	268
MURRAY	36311	I do like the moral black areas.	Murray.yack	269
GUYBRUSH	36312	How was your trip to Monkey Island?	Murray.yack	274
MURRAY	36313	Damp! People kept dropping me into cauldrons of glop for some reason.	Murray.yack	275
MURRAY	36314	But I'll have my revenge on all of them!	Murray.yack	276
MURRAY	36315	Especially that withered zombie man on LeChuck's crew!	Murray.yack	277
GUYBRUSH	36316	Are you getting a cut of The Secret, too?	Murray.yack	282
MURRAY	36317	They've promised me your skeleton. Minus the head, of course.	Murray.yack	283
GUYBRUSH	36318	How is it that you're not flat anymore?	Murray.yack	288
MURRAY	36319	What the? How did you know about that? Who've you been talking to?	Murray.yack	289
MURRAY	36320	I've got my eye on you, Threepwood!	Murray.yack	290
MURRAY	36321	So to speak.	Murray.yack	291
GUYBRUSH	36322	You make a lovely sound when struck with a bone.	Murray.yack	296
MURRAY	36323	Don't try to justify your abuse, you callous clod! Your day is coming!	Murray.yack	297
GUYBRUSH	36324	Is it uncomfortable to be stuck on a pointy stake?	Murray.yack	299
MURRAY	36325	I know an easy way you can find out.	Murray.yack	300
MURRAY	36326	Now stop bothering me.	Murray.yack	301
GUYBRUSH	36327	Hey Murray, anything on the horizon?	Murray.yack	310
MURRAY	36328	Only your eventual ultimate obliteration!	Murray.yack	311
GUYBRUSH	36329	See anything yet?	Murray.yack	316
MURRAY	36330	The future! The past. The terrible, terrible present!	Murray.yack	317
GUYBRUSH	36331	Watch the ship for me. Bite anyone who tries to steal it.	Murray.yack	322
MURRAY	36332	You're fine, there aren't any scrap lumber dealers on Mêlée.	Murray.yack	323
GUYBRUSH	36333	Don't get any funny ideas while I'm away from the ship.	Murray.yack	328
MURRAY	36334	No problem, I'll pretend I'm one of the writers.	Murray.yack	329
GUYBRUSH	36335	I'm sure you'll be safe here.	Murray.yack	334
MURRAY	36336	Worry about your own skin, Threepwood! I have no skin!	Murray.yack	335
GUYBRUSH	36337	This seems like your kind of place.	Murray.yack	340
MURRAY	36338	The stench of doom is exhilarating!	Murray.yack	341
GUYBRUSH	36339	To be honest, the Sea Monkey II feels a little less mighty next to LeChuck's triple wide barge.	Murray.yack	346
MURRAY	36340	No vessel can be outdone which bares my dread visage as its masthead! Not even your leaky tub!	Murray.yack	347
GUYBRUSH	36341	Thanks for the pep talk, Murray.	Murray.yack	348
MURRAY	36342	I dispense no “pep,” only terrible truths!	Murray.yack	349
GUYBRUSH	36343	I'm sorry I accidentally keelhauled you earlier. It won't happen again, I think.	Murray.yack	354
MURRAY	36344	Learn to tie a proper bowline hitch! How you've survived your own career this long, I'll never understand!	Murray.yack	355
GUYBRUSH	36345	Comfy?	Murray.yack	361
MURRAY	36346	When is my lunch break, as mandated by the Figureheads' Guild?	Murray.yack	362
GUYBRUSH	36347	Did you just make that up?	Murray.yack	363
MURRAY	36348	A good guild starts with an idea!	Murray.yack	364
GUYBRUSH	36349	Say, you're not still spying for Madison, are you?	Murray.yack	369
MURRAY	36350	Our alliance ended when she had me dropped from a precipice!	Murray.yack	370
GUYBRUSH	36351	I know, I just had this sudden weird idea that that might have been a setup.	Murray.yack	371
MURRAY	36352	Your paranoia is exceeded only by your oafishness!	Murray.yack	372
GUYBRUSH	36353	See anything yet?	Murray.yack	378
MURRAY	36354	I tire of your prattle. Go back to your poop deck.	Murray.yack	379
GUYBRUSH	36355	Keep up the good work, Murray.	Murray.yack	383
MURRAY	36356	I tire of your prattle.	Murray.yack	384

GUYBRUSH	32023	Yep. Identical.	Museum.dinky	51
GUYBRUSH	32024	There are some subtle differences. For example, the words “replica, not to scale” on the one in the case.	Museum.dinky	53
GUYBRUSH	32025	They look about the same.	Museum.dinky	59
GUYBRUSH	32026	Tell me about this flag?	Museum.dinky	84

CURATOR	32036	I've got some bad news. Someone stole Jon Laney's eyepatch!	Museum.dinky	163		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	32037	(feigned incredulity)No! Some people have no respect for private property.	Museum.dinky	165

CURATOR	32042	I'd better fold this and put it in storage, then I can figure out what's wrong with the lock.	Museum.dinky	323
CURATOR	32043	Looking good.	Museum.dinky	348
CURATOR	32044	I like things neat.	Museum.dinky	349
CURATOR	32045	Gotta get these edges perfect.	Museum.dinky	350

CURATOR	32047	Crisp creases.	Museum.dinky	352
CURATOR	32048	Left first, then right.	Museum.dinky	353

CURATOR	32058	Thieves, mostly.	Museum.dinky	658
GUYBRUSH	32059	Good to know.	Museum.dinky	660
GUYBRUSH	32060	Two parrots! Security has been beefed up. Or, I should say, parroted up.	Museum.dinky	664

CURATOR	32064	That's the pride of the collection!	Museum.dinky	725
GUYBRUSH	32065	Tell me again about the eyepatch?	Museum.dinky	727
CURATOR	32066	{enthused}It belonged to Captain Jon Laney, the pirate of a thousand faces!	Museum.dinky	730
CURATOR	32067	Supposedly it had voodoo powers that would disguise him!	Museum.dinky	732

GUYBRUSH	32071	There's nothing in there to steal.	Museum.dinky	801
GUYBRUSH	32072	It doesn't fit.	Museum.dinky	804
CURATOR	32073	What? Is something wrong?	Museum.dinky	811
GUYBRUSH	32074	I was just... wiping a smudge off the glass.	Museum.dinky	813
CURATOR	32075	Oh, all right. But be careful, guard parrots are attack trained.	Museum.dinky	815

GUYBRUSH	32084	Why do you have this big gear?	Museum.dinky	927
CURATOR	32085	It's from the Mêlée clock tower!	Museum.dinky	929
CURATOR	32086	Stolen during a pirate raid nearly seventy-five years ago, it was recently found at an inn on St. Maarten where it was being used to mill corn.	Museum.dinky	931
CURATOR	32087	I traded some old furniture for it that we had in the back room.	Museum.dinky	933
GUYBRUSH	32088	Has anyone thought about putting it back in the clock?	Museum.dinky	935

CURATOR	32101	Autographed by Francis Drake himself!	Museum.dinky	1019
HOVER	11167	Poke the plank	Museum.dinky	1024

GUYBRUSH	32103	Tell me again about the plank?	Museum.dinky	1041
HOVER	11168	Ask again about Pegleg Patty	Museum.dinky	1050
HOVER	11169	Hardly museum-worthy	Museum.dinky	1050
GUYBRUSH	32104	What's the significance of the pegleg?	Museum.dinky	1055
GUYBRUSH	32105	Tell me again about the lady with the pegleg?	Museum.dinky	1057
CURATOR	32106	That belonged to the infamous Pegleg Patty!	Museum.dinky	1060
CURATOR	32107	She used to hide a spare cutlass in it, in case of capture.	Museum.dinky	1062
CURATOR	32108	Sadly, that's the reason she's no longer with us.	Museum.dinky	1064
GUYBRUSH	32109	What's the significance of the pegleg?	Museum.dinky	1073
GUYBRUSH	32110	Tell me again about the lady with the pegleg?	Museum.dinky	1075

GUYBRUSH	32112	Tell me again about the mug?	Museum.dinky	1097
HOVER	11172	Ask again about Meathook's hook	Museum.dinky	1105
HOVER	11173	Make a joke about the hook	Museum.dinky	1105
GUYBRUSH	32113	Is this a left hook or a right hook?	Museum.dinky	1110
CURATOR	32114	That once belonged to the dread pirate Meathook!	Museum.dinky	1112
CURATOR	32115	Supposedly he was ambidextrous.	Museum.dinky	1114
CURATOR	32116	Also he used to live right here on Mêlée!	Museum.dinky	1116
GUYBRUSH	32117	Tell me again about the hook?	Museum.dinky	1118
CURATOR	32118	That once belonged to the dread pirate Meathook!	Museum.dinky	1120

HOVER	11174	Ask again about the wanted poster	Museum.dinky	1141

GUYBRUSH	32123	Where did you get this note?!	Museum.dinky	1173
GUYBRUSH	32124	Tell me again about the note?	Museum.dinky	1175
HOVER	11178	Maybe if I ask again he'll remember what the letter said	Museum.dinky	1184
HOVER	11179	That's seen better days	Museum.dinky	1184
GUYBRUSH	32125	What was this cinder you've got on the wall?	Museum.dinky	1189
CURATOR	32126	Oh, that. Yeah.	Museum.dinky	1191
CURATOR	32127	That was an unsent love letter, written by Elaine Marley while she was governor of the island.	Museum.dinky	1193
GUYBRUSH	32128	{surprised}What?! Elaine?!	Museum.dinky	1195
CURATOR	32129	The recipient was referred to only as “Plunder Bunny.”	Museum.dinky	1197
GUYBRUSH	32130	{point_self}That's me!	Museum.dinky	1199
CURATOR	32131	It was a really touching letter! Unfortunately, I put the candle too close to it...	Museum.dinky	1201
GUYBRUSH	32132	{surprised}What did it say! Tell me what she said!	Museum.dinky	1203
CURATOR	32133	Oh, you know. Love letter stuff. Honestly I don't remember a word of it. But it was touching.	Museum.dinky	1205
GUYBRUSH	32134	Thanks a lot.	Museum.dinky	1207
GUYBRUSH	32135	Actually I think I'd rather not hear about that again.	Museum.dinky	1209
GUYBRUSH	32136	What was this cinder you've got on the wall?	Museum.dinky	1218
HOVER	11180	Reminisce about the map	Museum.dinky	1227
HOVER	11181	Isn't that part of my old map?	Museum.dinky	1227
GUYBRUSH	32137	That map looks familiar.	Museum.dinky	1237
GUYBRUSH	32138	Tell me again about the map?	Museum.dinky	1239
HOVER	11390	Leave the forest	MuseumExterior.dinky	140
HOVER	11391	To the deep dark forest	MuseumExterior.dinky	157
HOVER	11392	To the deep dark forest where I'm sure to get lost	MuseumExterior.dinky	157
HOVER	11393	Read the sign	MuseumExterior.dinky	169
GUYBRUSH	32406	“WARNING! The dark forest ahead is deadly and twisty, maps are highly recommended.”	MuseumExterior.dinky	172

HOVER	11395	Visit the museum	MuseumExterior.dinky	178
GUYBRUSH	32407	“At Chamber of Commerce Midnight Luncheon, back shortly.”	MuseumExterior.dinky	185
HOVER	11396	I guess another visit is out of the question	MuseumExterior.dinky	192
HOVER	11397	Hey, this used to be Carla's place!	MuseumExterior.dinky	192
GUYBRUSH	32408	The light's off, looks like they're closed.	MuseumExterior.dinky	195
GUYBRUSH	32409	Once upon a time I won a T-shirt right here on the front lawn.	MuseumExterior.dinky	197
HOVER	11398	This is a lot of crime scene tape	MuseumExterior.dinky	215
GUYBRUSH	32410	My brilliant deduction is that the museum is closed.	MuseumExterior.dinky	217
HOVER	11399	Read the sign	MuseumExterior.dinky	223
GUYBRUSH	32411	“Museum of Pirate Lore.”	MuseumExterior.dinky	225
GUYBRUSH	32412	It's the Museum of Pirate Lore, but it says it's closed.	MuseumExterior.dinky	225
HOVER	11400	Look at the museum door	MuseumExterior.dinky	231
GUYBRUSH	32413	The light's off, looks like they're closed.	MuseumExterior.dinky	233
HOVER	11401	Admire the tiny climbing ship	MuseumExterior.dinky	239
GUYBRUSH	32414	I used to love these when I was six.	MuseumExterior.dinky	241
HOVER	11402	Admire the large climbing chest	MuseumExterior.dinky	247
GUYBRUSH	32415	I used to love these when I was six, until I got trapped in one for two days.	MuseumExterior.dinky	249
GUYBRUSH	32416	I think they're illegal now.	MuseumExterior.dinky	249
NED	33542	Not now, I'm packing!	Ned.yack	19
NED	33543	Stay back! I can see you! How did you find me?!	Ned.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	33544	I... I just sailed up and here you were?	Ned.yack	31
NED	33545	Who are you?!?!	Ned.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	33546	{point_self}I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!	Ned.yack	33
NED	33547	Are you alone?	Ned.yack	34
GUYBRUSH	33548	At the moment.	Ned.yack	36
NED	33549	Thank goodness!	Ned.yack	37
GUYBRUSH	33550	Do obnoxious talking skulls count?	Ned.yack	38
NED	33551	No.	Ned.yack	39
GUYBRUSH	33552	Then yes, I'm alone.	Ned.yack	40
MURRAY	33553	I heard that!	Ned.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	33554	My crew are belowdecks.	Ned.yack	42
GUYBRUSH	33555	(badly lying)Working. Working hard.	Ned.yack	43
GUYBRUSH	33556	(badly lying)And counting our pirate swag.	Ned.yack	44
NED	33557	You know, stolen goods can't be taxed if you don't disclose them.	Ned.yack	45
GUYBRUSH	33558	Of course not. You're here.	Ned.yack	46
NED	33559	(nervous)A-heh. Yes, I'm sure that would be funny under other circumstances.	Ned.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	33560	No, I'm happily married.	Ned.yack	48
NED	33561	Did you know that gifts between married couples are non-taxable?	Ned.yack	49
GUYBRUSH	33562	I didn't! That's good advice.	Ned.yack	50
NED	33563	I'm Ned Filigree, accountant. I don't mean to be rude, it's just that I'm in hiding.	Ned.yack	52
NED	33564	Hold it!	Ned.yack	57
NED	33565	Are you sure you weren't followed?	Ned.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	33566	We're safe.	Ned.yack	59
NED	33567	No one is ever a hundred percent safe.	Ned.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	33568	You wouldn't happen to have any business records pertaining to one Stan S. Stanman, would you?	Ned.yack	65
NED	33569	(panic)What? Who told you that? I can't confirm that! I will neither confirm nor deny possession of any incriminating, I mean...	Ned.yack	68
NED	33570	(panic)...I mean it doesn't matter anyway! Stan is serving a lengthy sentence! There's no need for any more evidence against him, simply no need!	Ned.yack	69
GUYBRUSH	33571	So you confirm that you deny possession of Stan's records?	Ned.yack	71
NED	33572	What? Yes. I mean no! I confirm nothing! What difference does it make?	Ned.yack	72
NED	33573	Stan is already serving a lengthy sentence! There's no need for any more evidence against him!	Ned.yack	73
GUYBRUSH	33574	Do you deny that you have ever possessed confirmation of Stan's records?	Ned.yack	75
NED	33575	Any denial of confirmation is not to be taken as confirmation of denial. Not that I have done either one.	Ned.yack	76
GUYBRUSH	33576	Is it true that you deny confirming denial of non-confirmation of Stan's business records?	Ned.yack	78
NED	33577	Now you're just trying to confuse me!	Ned.yack	79
GUYBRUSH	33578	Who is it you're afraid of?	Ned.yack	81
NED	33579	(reluctant)Well...	Ned.yack	84
NED	33580	Have you heard of Stan S. Stanman?	Ned.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	33581	The name sounds familiar.	Ned.yack	86
NED	33582	Stan, of course! Stan Stanman!	Ned.yack	87
NED	33583	Thank goodness they locked him away on Brrr Muda!	Ned.yack	88
NED	33584	He'll be chipping ice in the quarry for a long, long time.	Ned.yack	89
NED	33585	I can't help but be nervous, but actually I guess I've got decades before I really have to worry about it.	Ned.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	33586	How come you're afraid of Stan?	Ned.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	33587	He's always struck me as pretty harmless, except economically.	Ned.yack	94
NED	33588	Sure, but you never can tell what someone like Stan will do. He's got no moral center.	Ned.yack	95
GUYBRUSH	33589	There's that term again...	Ned.yack	96
NED	33590	Like I said, I'm glad he's safely stuck in the Brrr Muda quarry for a good long time.	Ned.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	33591	Are you sure you don't have any of Stan's business records?	Ned.yack	99
NED	33592	As I said before, Stan is already serving a lengthy sentence! There's no need for any more evidence against him!	Ned.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	33593	Where did you say they were keeping Stan, again?	Ned.yack	102
NED	33594	The ice quarry on Brrr Muda!	Ned.yack	103
NED	33595	He'll be there for years and years, and more years after that, thank goodness.	Ned.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	33596	You must be good at math.	Ned.yack	106
NED	33597	I'm a “creative” accountant. Math doesn't really enter into it.	Ned.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	33598	You any good?	Ned.yack	108
NED	33599	Don't judge me by where I live. I've just had a few setbacks. It's all I can afford right now, but it's temporary.	Ned.yack	109
GUYBRUSH	33600	{proud}I'm on a quest to recover The Secret of Monkey Island!	Ned.yack	111
NED	33601	That's a good move.	Ned.yack	112
NED	33602	I've heard The Secret is a one-of-a-kind intangible, which means you can assign it whatever value you want to.	Ned.yack	113
NED	33603	Also since it's very old, you can claim a lot of depreciation.	Ned.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	33604	Wait, are you trying to tell me I'm going to have to pay taxes on The Secret?	Ned.yack	115
NED	33605	Not if you're smart about it!	Ned.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	33606	I'm going to explore the island a little bit.	Ned.yack	118
NED	33607	Holler if you find anything interesting.	Ned.yack	119
GUYBRUSH	33608	I think you might be interested in this judicial order in the case against Stan S. Stanman.	Ned.yack	127
NED	33609	(panic)Whaaa?! What's this? Only a month?! Oh no!	Ned.yack	137		UPDATE
NED	33610	Take these records!	Ned.yack	152
NED	33611	Get them to the courthouse on Brrr Muda! They'll know what to do with them!	Ned.yack	159
NED	33612	It's very damaging stuff, Stan will get ten years at a minimum!	Ned.yack	165
NED	33613	I'd take care of it myself but I've got to pack for witness protection! Oh, goodness!	Ned.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	37479	Have you seen the pirate leaders around? This is their table.	NewLeaders.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	37480	In fact you'd probably better move, you don't want to get caught sitting here.	NewLeaders.yack	42
CAPTAINTRENT	37481	It's our table, rummy!	NewLeaders.yack	49
CAPTAINLILA	37482	We're the 'pirate leaders'.	NewLeaders.yack	57
CAPTAINMADISON	37483	Get lost!	NewLeaders.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	37484	I hadn't heard there was a change of leadership.	NewLeaders.yack	72
CAPTAINMADISON	37485	(sarcasm)Oh no, did nobody remember to notify you?	NewLeaders.yack	73
CAPTAINLILA	37486	(sarcasm)Maybe your party invite got lost in the mail.	NewLeaders.yack	74
GUYBRUSH	37488	Where are the three older guys who used to hold court here?	NewLeaders.yack	79
CAPTAINMADISON	37489	Who cares?	NewLeaders.yack	80
CAPTAINTRENT	37490	Probably crying in an alley somewhere, wishing they were still relevant.	NewLeaders.yack	81
CAPTAINLILA	37491	Making up “trials” for each other and writing memoirs that no one will read.	NewLeaders.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	37492	Is it you I should talk to about financing an expedition?	NewLeaders.yack	87
CAPTAINMADISON	37493	An expedition! Who is it that you think you are, exactly?	NewLeaders.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	37494	{proud}I'm Guybrush Threepwood. Probably you've heard of me.	NewLeaders.yack	93
CAPTAINMADISON	37495	Probably not.	NewLeaders.yack	94
GUYBRUSH	37496	{brag}I'm the rock-solid investment you've been waiting for!	NewLeaders.yack	95
CAPTAINMADISON	37497	Spare me the greasy sales pitch.	NewLeaders.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	37498	{happy}Just a humble pirate, unworthy to be in your august presence.	NewLeaders.yack	97
CAPTAINMADISON	37499	And yet here you are.	NewLeaders.yack	98
CAPTAINLILA	37500	Permission to slaughter the annoying old wastrel man, Captain Madison?	NewLeaders.yack	100
BOYBRUSH	37501	Wait, it was Captain Madison? She's like, famous!	NewLeaders.yack	107
BOYBRUSH	37502	{enthusiastic}I've got her on a trading card, her plunder stats are amazing!	NewLeaders.yack	109
GUYBRUSH	37503	Plunder stats aren't everything.	NewLeaders.yack	111
BOYBRUSH	37504	{confused}Then the others were Captain Lila and Captain Trent? It was Lila who threatened to kill you?	NewLeaders.yack	113
GUYBRUSH	37505	Look, they weren't that great, okay? Listen to the story.	NewLeaders.yack	115
CAPTAINLILA	37506	Want me to slaughter him?	NewLeaders.yack	123
CAPTAINMADISON	37507	Don't bother, he's just a harmless hack who thinks he has a good idea for a pirate raid.	NewLeaders.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	37508	[silent]It's not exactly a raid.	NewLeaders.yack	127
GUYBRUSH	37509	It's not exactly a raid.	NewLeaders.yack	130
CAPTAINMADISON	37510	What else would we be interested in?	NewLeaders.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	37511	[silent]Exactly, it's a raid.	NewLeaders.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	37512	Exactly, it's a raid.	NewLeaders.yack	142
CAPTAINMADISON	37513	Fine. Well don't keep us in suspense, what's the target?	NewLeaders.yack	147		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37514	[silent]I'm going to find The Secret of Monkey Island!	NewLeaders.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	37515	I'm going to find The Secret of Monkey Island!	NewLeaders.yack	155
CAPTAINMADISON	37518	You're wasting our time.	NewLeaders.yack	160
CAPTAINTRENT	37519	The Secret, I didn't think that was even a real thing?	NewLeaders.yack	161
GUYBRUSH	37520	It's a prize of incalculable monetary value!	NewLeaders.yack	166
CAPTAINMADISON	37521	I don't know about incalculable. Quick, who can count to zero the fastest?	NewLeaders.yack	167
GUYBRUSH	37522	It's a prize of incredible cultural value!	NewLeaders.yack	168
CAPTAINTRENT	37523	Culture, you mean like a cheese or something?	NewLeaders.yack	169		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37524	It's a mystery for the ages that must be solved!	NewLeaders.yack	170
CAPTAINMADISON	37525	The only mystery here is who let you into this bar.	NewLeaders.yack	171
GUYBRUSH	37526	It's a personal passion of mine. I really want to find it.	NewLeaders.yack	172
CAPTAINLILA	37527	Your weird fetishes are not something I need to hear about.	NewLeaders.yack	173
CAPTAINMADISON	37528	[overlap]Ha ha ha!	NewLeaders.yack	177
CAPTAINLILA	37529	[overlap][low]Ha ha ha!	NewLeaders.yack	178
CAPTAINTRENT	37530	[overlap][high]Ha ha ha!	NewLeaders.yack	179
GUYBRUSH	37531	Heh heh.	NewLeaders.yack	183
GUYBRUSH	37532	Okay, I'm sensing some reluctance, but hear me out.	NewLeaders.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	37533	Would you at least consider advancing me some funds?	NewLeaders.yack	192
GUYBRUSH	37534	With backing I can work it out.	NewLeaders.yack	193
GUYBRUSH	37535	I could make it worth your while to help me hire a crew.	NewLeaders.yack	194
GUYBRUSH	37536	(needs some confidence to match the other choices, it might be the first pitch)Could you at least point me towards an available ship?	NewLeaders.yack	195
GUYBRUSH	37537	If you don't take this opportunity, LeChuck will grab it.	NewLeaders.yack	196
GUYBRUSH	37538	It's a sure-fire investment. Triple your money or your money back.	NewLeaders.yack	200
CAPTAINMADISON	37539	Not interested.	NewLeaders.yack	201
GUYBRUSH	37540	A percentage of their earnings or something.	NewLeaders.yack	206
CAPTAINMADISON	37541	No one in here wants to chase your pipe dream.	NewLeaders.yack	207
CAPTAINLILA	37543	You don't even have a ship?	NewLeaders.yack	216
CAPTAINMADISON	37544	You're really up a creek.	NewLeaders.yack	222
CAPTAINTRENT	37545	Up a creek without a ship! Ha ha ha!	NewLeaders.yack	228
CAPTAINMADISON	37551	LeChuck?	NewLeaders.yack	239
GUYBRUSH	37552	Yes, the dreaded zombie ghost pirate LeChuck himself is also going after The Secret!	NewLeaders.yack	240
GUYBRUSH	37553	{point_hold}He's here in Mêlée getting ready right now!	NewLeaders.yack	241
GUYBRUSH	37554	If that doesn't prove it's a worthwhile venture I don't know what else to tell you.	NewLeaders.yack	242
CAPTAINLILA	37555	Great, problem solved!	NewLeaders.yack	243
GUYBRUSH	37556	Excellent, you'll do it!	NewLeaders.yack	244
CAPTAINMADISON	37557	Ha! No, of course not!	NewLeaders.yack	245
CAPTAINMADISON	37558	Why waste money on an expedition when you can just join the one that's already going?	NewLeaders.yack	246
CAPTAINLILA	37559	Have fun with your scary ghost friend. Bye bye!	NewLeaders.yack	247
GUYBRUSH	37560	The slight problem with that idea is that LeChuck and I are basically mortal enemies.	NewLeaders.yack	249

GUYBRUSH	37580	{brag}I can do this on my own!	NewLeaders.yack	313
GUYBRUSH	39352	If I can't buy a ship, I'll steal one! I'm a pirate!	NewLeaders.yack	321
GUYBRUSH	39353	{proud}I'll find a way to get to Monkey Island, no matter what it takes!	NewLeaders.yack	326
GUYBRUSH	37584	I liked the old pirate leaders better.	NewLeaders.yack	333
GUYBRUSH	37585	Are you sure I can't persuade you to back my expedition to Monkey Island?	NewLeaders.yack	343
CAPTAINTRENT	37586	(sarcasm)The mop is really convincing me.	NewLeaders.yack	346
CAPTAINLILA	37587	You must run a tidy ship!	NewLeaders.yack	347

CAPTAINTRENT	37591	Trials?	NewLeaders.yack	356
CAPTAINLILA	37592	It's how they used to make their bones in the old days.	NewLeaders.yack	357
GUYBRUSH	37593	I defeated the Ghost Pirate LeChuck!	NewLeaders.yack	359
GUYBRUSH	37594	Several times!	NewLeaders.yack	360
CAPTAINLILA	37595	Super ironic that sailing with him is the only way you're getting to Monkey Island.	NewLeaders.yack	361
GUYBRUSH	37596	I solve a lot of puzzles with my wits.	NewLeaders.yack	363
GUYBRUSH	37597	I have a great sense of humor and like long walks on the beach.	NewLeaders.yack	364
GUYBRUSH	37598	I can hold my breath for ten minutes!	NewLeaders.yack	365
CAPTAINMADISON	37599	(no way)Ten minutes? Really?	NewLeaders.yack	366
GUYBRUSH	37600	Well... it's been a while, but I could probably still do ten minutes on a good day.	NewLeaders.yack	367
GUYBRUSH	37601	Actually, never mind.	NewLeaders.yack	369
CAPTAINMADISON	37602	I thought so.	NewLeaders.yack	370
CAPTAINMADISON	37603	Well I was a director of combat operations for the British Navy, and I've written two books on ship-to-ship tactics.	NewLeaders.yack	374
CAPTAINTRENT	37604	I'm a founding member and co-director of the Red Fleet, and hold records for civilian casualties from San Domingo to Venezuela.	NewLeaders.yack	375
CAPTAINLILA	37605	I'm an expert in seventeen forms of hand-to-hand combat, three of which I invented.	NewLeaders.yack	376
CAPTAINLILA	37606	I served with Bellamy, Teach, and Roberts, before they each met an untimely end that I might have had nothing to do with.	NewLeaders.yack	377
CAPTAINMADISON	37607	Just so you know, this is the kind of resume we expect.	NewLeaders.yack	378
GUYBRUSH	37608	Oh.	NewLeaders.yack	379
CAPTAINMADISON	37609	Yes.	NewLeaders.yack	381
GUYBRUSH	40072	(scared)-gulp-	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	3		DELETE
GUYBRUSH	34360	Hey, “partners.”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	25
CAPTAINMADISON	34361	Hey, “partner.”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	33
CAPTAINMADISON	34362	What are you still hanging around for? You have a disguise, go get on LeChuck's ship and come back with some secrets already!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	44
CAPTAINMADISON	34363	We're ready on our end. Have you learned LeChuck's secrets yet?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	48
CAPTAINMADISON	38982	How's that theme music going, is there a problem?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	49
GUYBRUSH	38983	I... may have overestimated my readiness.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	50
GUYBRUSH	34364	Look what I found, LeChuck's very own diary.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	55
CAPTAINMADISON	34365	Have you learned LeChuck's secrets yet?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	34366	I know all of LeChuck's secrets, let's do this thing.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	34367	{thinking}Ummm... yes?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	34368	I know what LeChuck's favorite food is.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	70
CAPTAINLILA	34369	It's not enough just to know it. We eat it during the ritual, you have to get some.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	34370	Right, you might have mentioned that.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	73
GUYBRUSH	34371	I think I know LeChuck's catchphrase.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	34372	I know how LeChuck's theme music goes.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	76
GUYBRUSH	34373	I've got some of LeChuck's favorite food.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	34374	I know LeChuck's favorite food.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	78
GUYBRUSH	34375	I'm worried LeChuck's crew will recognize me at the ship.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	34376	I had a disguise before, but it's gone now.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	34377	I ran into some trouble boarding the ship.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	34378	I haven't found his catchphrase.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	34379	I haven't found his theme song.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	34380	I haven't got a sample of his favorite food.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	34381	I haven't found out what his favorite food is.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	87
GUYBRUSH	34382	Can I really trust you?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	88
CAPTAINMADISON	34383	[overlap][high]Absolutely!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	89
CAPTAINLILA	34384	[overlap]Totally!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	90
CAPTAINTRENT	34385	[overlap][low]Completely!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	91
MURRAY	34386	[right][overlap]No.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	92
GUYBRUSH	34387	I'll get back to it.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	100
CAPTAINMADISON	34388	Be quick about it.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	101
CAPTAINLILA	34389	Did you bring something secret from one of the crew?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	34390	I did.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	34391	Remind me what you need to make a disguise?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	108
GUYBRUSH	34392	Not yet, I'll work on that.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	109
CAPTAINMADISON	34393	Be quick about it.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	110
CAPTAINMADISON	34394	Is it the enchantment, keeping you off?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	115
CAPTAINTRENT	34395	Good news, we get to kill him after all.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	34396	{handsup}No, that's not it.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	117
GUYBRUSH	34397	I lost my eye-patch disguise, so the crew knows it's me and they won't let me back on.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	118
CAPTAINLILA	34398	You need to look like one of them. I know a good spell that can do that.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	120
CAPTAINLILA	34399	I'll need a secret to build it on.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	121
CAPTAINLILA	34400	Get me a physical object from one of the crew, something they would keep hidden from the others.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	127
GUYBRUSH	34401	Okay. I'll see what I can come up with.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	129
GUYBRUSH	34402	I already found a secret thing from one of the crew.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	133
GUYBRUSH	34403	[center]Gullet was keeping this under wraps.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	34404	Can you use it to make a disguise?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	153
CAPTAINLILA	34405	[center](quoting a phrase)“Like chomping worms or colorful germs...”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	179
CAPTAINLILA	34406	[center](quoting a phrase)“Twisting worms and twisting words...”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	180
CAPTAINLILA	34407	[center](quoting a phrase)“Slimy worms that wryly squirm...”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	181

CAPTAINLILA	34409	[center](quoting a phrase)“Septicemia and twisting worms...”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	183
CAPTAINLILA	34410	[center]I can see why someone would want to keep this a secret. It's drivel. It's perfect!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	185
CAPTAINLILA	34411	[center](incantation)Qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor, sit amet.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	217

CAPTAINLILA	34416	Use the first poem to activate the disguise, and the last one to be yourself again.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	301
GUYBRUSH	34417	Fantastic, thanks!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	302
CAPTAINMADISON	34418	Keep us looped in on your progress.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	303		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	34419	Yep, will do!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	304
CAPTAINMADISON	34420	Did you search for clues on his ship?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	315
GUYBRUSH	34421	{shrug}Maybe not the WHOLE ship...	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	316
GUYBRUSH	34422	I'm not sure he's even got one.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	320
CAPTAINMADISON	34423	With an ego the size of LeChuck's? He's definitely commissioned something.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	321
CAPTAINLILA	34424	Remember it's not enough just to know what it is, we need some of it for the ritual.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	327
GUYBRUSH	34425	Oh, right. You may have mentioned that.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	328
CAPTAINMADISON	34426	Did you check with his cook?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	330
GUYBRUSH	34427	I did. And she likes Gullet, as far as I can tell.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	332
CAPTAINLILA	34428	Butter her up a little. Confidential information slides out of people better when you do that.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	333
GUYBRUSH	34429	I haven't even been back on board the ship.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	336
GUYBRUSH	34430	Oh, right. Putra might know something.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	337
CAPTAINLILA	34431	(expectant)Well?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	343
GUYBRUSH	34432	{thinking}It occurs to me that if I tell you the secrets before we do whatever ritual thing it is you're planning, I lose all my leverage.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	344
CAPTAINMADISON	34433	This is a relationship built on trust.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	346
GUYBRUSH	34434	Then I guess you'll just have to trust me.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	347
GUYBRUSH	34435	I'll let you know when I have all the information, and then we'll do the ritual together.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	348
CAPTAINMADISON	34436	Fine, fine.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	349
CAPTAINLILA	34437	Just hurry up.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	350
CAPTAINLILA	34438	Okay, let's get started!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	356
CAPTAINLILA	34439	The first step is to play LeChuck's theme music.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	357
CAPTAINLILA	34440	You're the one who knows how it goes, so you're in charge.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	359
CAPTAINLILA	34441	Your instrument is over there.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	360
MURRAY	34442	Watch who you're calling an instrument!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	368
CAPTAINLILA	34443	That's promising!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	386
CAPTAINLILA	34444	Next step! Madison, let's have the map!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	387

CAPTAINLILA	34446	(incantation)[center]Laboris nisi ex commodo consequat.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	426
CAPTAINLILA	34447	(stage whisper)[center]Quick, say LeChuck's catchphrase!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	432
GUYBRUSH	34448	Um... “You fight like a cow!”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	448
GUYBRUSH	34449	“Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	449
GUYBRUSH	34450	“I'm selling these fine leather jackets!”	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	450
CAPTAINMADISON	34451	Really?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	452
CAPTAINLILA	34452	(incantation)[center]Quis autem vel voluptate velit!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	501
CAPTAINLILA	34453	(stage whisper)[center]Now, eat LeChuck's favorite food!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	505
GUYBRUSH	34454	Eat it? I thought I just had to know what it was!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	517
GUYBRUSH	34455	Oh, whoops. I forgot to get it.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	518
GUYBRUSH	34456	Do I have to?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	519
CAPTAINLILA	34457	Yes!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	520
GUYBRUSH	34458	Can't someone else do it?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	522
CAPTAINLILA	34459	No!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	523
GUYBRUSH	34460	Okay...	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	525
CAPTAINLILA	34461	No! When we first talked about this I said we have to eat it!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	548
CAPTAINLILA	34462	You didn't bring any?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	549
GUYBRUSH	34463	Uh... no.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	550
CAPTAINLILA	34464	We told you to go and get some!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	552
CAPTAINMADISON	34465	Ugh. Fine. Go and get some of whatever it is, and we'll try it again.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	554
CAPTAINMADISON	34466	Well?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	562
CAPTAINTRENT	34467	Nothing's happening!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	563
CAPTAINLILA	34468	You must have screwed something up, Guybrush. Get it right next time.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	565
CAPTAINMADISON	34469	Come back when you know the right answers.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	571

GUYBRUSH	34478	What happened to our deal?	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	804
CAPTAINMADISON	34479	Don't pretend you didn't intend to double-cross us and steal the map the first chance you got.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	805
GUYBRUSH	34480	You don't know that for sure.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	806
CAPTAINLILA	34481	It's in your todo list!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	809
GUYBRUSH	34482	There's still time to let me go.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	811
CAPTAINLILA	34483	Time to go then!	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	814
GUYBRUSH	34484	Let's take a vote on kicking me off the cliff.	NewLeadersMonkeyHead.yack	816

FISHER1	36890	Nay.	OldLeaders.yack	78
FISHMONGER	36891	Stan's were the only place for ships.	OldLeaders.yack	79
FISHER1	36892	They've shut it down, and thrown the man into jail.	OldLeaders.yack	80		UPDATE
FISHMONGER	36893	Afraid you're out of luck.	OldLeaders.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	36894	No ships. I wonder if I really should be trying to get on LeChuck's ship...	OldLeaders.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	36895	Tell me about your next venture! What is it?	OldLeaders.yack	84
FISHMONGER	36896	Tis a fish shop! On the High Street, where the general store used to be.	OldLeaders.yack	87
FISHER1	36897	A place for the buyin' of fish, and tellin' tales about the catchin' of fish.	OldLeaders.yack	88		UPDATE
FISHMONGER	36898	We'll be open on the morrow. Be sure to stop by.	OldLeaders.yack	89
FISHER1	36899	We'll give you the “friends” price on the unpopular fish.	OldLeaders.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	36900	You said you don't have a ship. Where do you get your fish?	OldLeaders.yack	91
FISHMONGER	36901	From reputable sources!	OldLeaders.yack	92
FISHER1	36902	We'll give you an additional discount if you don't talk about that where people can hear you.	OldLeaders.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	36903	How is it that you're not the pirate leaders anymore?	OldLeaders.yack	95
FISHMONGER	36904	Time and democracy, boy.	OldLeaders.yack	97
FISHER1	36905	Lot of our supporters be dead, drunk, dead drunk, or retired.	OldLeaders.yack	98
FISHMONGER	36906	Our eyes be sharp and our judgments keen, but once ye be labeled “old school,” that's all that gets seen.	OldLeaders.yack	99		UPDATE
FISHER1	36907	The traditions of the Three Trials have become a jokin' matter in some quarters.	OldLeaders.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	36908	Dark times.	OldLeaders.yack	101
FISHMONGER	36909	Aye. They even water the grog and mix it with fruit these days. Won't even strip the varnish off a deck.	OldLeaders.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	36910	Why'd you pick this corner instead of one closer to your fish shop?	OldLeaders.yack	104
FISHER1	36911	The woman as lives above the shop location is doing a bit of haranguing today.	OldLeaders.yack	106
FISHER1	36913	We'll stay clear of her, thanks very much.	OldLeaders.yack	107		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	36914	I'll see you around.	OldLeaders.yack	109
FISHER1	36915	Seems likely.	OldLeaders.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	36916	What's new, guys?	OldLeaders.yack	114
FISHMONGER	36917	Not much, but be sure to come see us at the shop tomorrow.	OldLeaders.yack	115
GUYBRUSH	34497	Wow!	OpenSafe.yack	45
GUYBRUSH	40135	(Tearing up) Big sniff	OpenSafe.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	34498	It's cheesier than I imagined.	OpenSafe.yack	57
GUYBRUSH	34499	But still beautiful!	OpenSafe.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	34500	Okay. Hm.	OpenSafe.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	34501	I wasn't really thinking about the possibility of yet another lock. This seems like overkill.	OpenSafe.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	40136	(Carrying chest) Straining	OpenSafe.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	40137	(Tripping) Ahh!	OpenSafe.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	40138	(Pushing chest onto table) Straining	OpenSafe.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	34502	There's no serial number...	OpenSafe.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	34503	Maybe I can break it open.	OpenSafe.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	34504	(extreme frustration)Aaaaarrrggghhh!	OpenSafe.yack	112
GUYBRUSH	40245	(BITE)	OpenSafe.yack	118
GUYBRUSH	40246	(CHOMP)	OpenSafe.yack	119
GUYBRUSH	40247	(NIBBLE!)	OpenSafe.yack	120
GUYBRUSH	34505	This is not a problem. I choose to see it as a puzzle.	OpenSafe.yack	122
GUYBRUSH	34506	This is not a problem. I just need heftier tools.	OpenSafe.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	34507	This is not a problem. The key is probably somewhere obvious.	OpenSafe.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	34508	This is not a problem. Just keep telling yourself that, Guybrush.	OpenSafe.yack	125
GUYBRUSH	40139	(With sledgehammer) Straining	OpenSafe.yack	136
LECHUCK	39663	THREEPWOOD!	OpenSafe.yack	138
GUYBRUSH	40140	(Frustrated) Aaaahhh!!	OpenSafe.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	39664	LeChuck, my old nemesis!	OpenSafe.yack	200
GUYBRUSH	39665	Here we are again.	OpenSafe.yack	201
GUYBRUSH	39666	Looks like this story ends the way it was always destined to end!	OpenSafe.yack	202
GUYBRUSH	39667	With just you, and me, and The Secret!	OpenSafe.yack	203
GUYBRUSH	40141	(Surprised) Gasp!	OpenSafe.yack	203
LECHUCK	39668	Not quite.	OpenSafe.yack	204
GUYBRUSH	39669	I don't suppose it'll do me any good to point out that you're cheating again.	OpenSafe.yack	213
LECHUCK	39670	I've underestimated your resourcefulness, Threepwood. But, force always wins in the end.	OpenSafe.yack	223
LECHUCK	39671	You should try it sometime.	OpenSafe.yack	230
GUYBRUSH	34522	Good luck opening that. It's well-made. I tried everything I could think of for a whole minute, and I didn't make a dent in it.	OpenSafe.yack	238
LECHUCK	34523	Of course not. The Secret can only be revealed in a ceremonial chamber located deep within the bowels of Monkey Island.	OpenSafe.yack	251
GUYBRUSH	39672	That would have been nice to know ahead of time.	OpenSafe.yack	252
LECHUCK	39673	It pleases me to have you live with the knowledge of how close you were to having this before I took it from you.	OpenSafe.yack	258
LECHUCK	39674	So I've decided not to kill you right this minute.	OpenSafe.yack	259
LECHUCK	34532	Outside that door, the deal is off.	OpenSafe.yack	261
LECHUCK	34533	Don't even think about following me. And count to a hundred before you leave the building.	OpenSafe.yack	262
GUYBRUSH	39675	You won't get away with this!	OpenSafe.yack	286
GUYBRUSH	34536	A hundred!	OpenSafe.yack	287
GUYBRUSH	34537	One...	OpenSafe.yack	288

ELAINE	34548	Guybrush!	OpenSafe.yack	312
ELAINE	39676	Widey Bones said she saw you come in. Are you all right?	OpenSafe.yack	317
GUYBRUSH	34550	No. I mean yes. I'm fine.	OpenSafe.yack	318
ELAINE	39677	Do you want to talk about it?	OpenSafe.yack	319
GUYBRUSH	34552	LeChuck has The Secret and he's headed for “the bowels of Monkey Island.”	OpenSafe.yack	320
ELAINE	34553	The caverns underneath the big monkey head?	OpenSafe.yack	321
GUYBRUSH	34554	There's no time to lose. Let's talk on the way.	OpenSafe.yack	323
ELAINE	39322	Here we go! Just like old times.	OpenTheHead.yack	12
ELAINE	39323	Are you ready for the caverns?	OpenTheHead.yack	17
GUYBRUSH	39324	I remember them. There are mushrooms. Big ones.	OpenTheHead.yack	22
ELAINE	39325	Oh, Guybrush. Even in the caverns probably only eighty percent of those are deadly poison.	OpenTheHead.yack	24
GUYBRUSH	39326	I remember them. Full of lava and tiny ledges.	OpenTheHead.yack	26
ELAINE	39327	It's a good thing you're wearing your adventure boots.	OpenTheHead.yack	28		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	39328	I hate mazes.	OpenTheHead.yack	30
ELAINE	39329	We all hate mazes.	OpenTheHead.yack	32
FLAIRGOREY	39330	How about I remove your liver so you don't have to worry about it?	OpenTheHead.yack	40
FLAIRGOREY	39331	Hope you also brought your adventure sword.	OpenTheHead.yack	43
FLAIRGOREY	39332	I love mazes.	OpenTheHead.yack	45

OTIS	39159	I don't crew ships anymore, but maybe you can still help me out, like you did all those years ago!	Otis.yack	61
GUYBRUSH	35795	{thinking}Possibly, though, it was kind of tricky last time, and I didn't get much out of it in the end.	Otis.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	35796	I'm sort of planning on hijacking an existing crew instead of recruiting one. But maybe I can spring you anyway, for old times' sake.	Otis.yack	63
OTIS	35797	I would be most appreciative.	Otis.yack	64
OTIS	35798	A locksmith has opened very conveniently across the way. I'm told locksmiths can make keys for things! Things like cell doors.	Otis.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	35799	Imagine that!	Otis.yack	66
OTIS	35800	I'm a victim of circumstance.	Otis.yack	72
OTIS	35801	Circumstance being, that too much attention gets paid to little things that don't hurt anyone, while hard killers roam the streets with pistols and swords.	Otis.yack	73
OTIS	35802	It was nothing. I was just picking some flowers.	Otis.yack	78
GUYBRUSH	35803	In the forest?	Otis.yack	79
OTIS	35804	No! That's illegal. I learned my lesson.	Otis.yack	80
OTIS	35805	I picked them from the governor's garden instead.	Otis.yack	81
OTIS	35806	We used to be friends! Sort of.	Otis.yack	86
OTIS	35807	Anyway they aren't even her flowers. Taxes pay for them. It's public property.	Otis.yack	87
OTIS	35808	I don't know why anyone bothers me about it. I don't hurt anybody.	Otis.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	35809	Except the flowers.	Otis.yack	89
OTIS	35810	They're annuals! They're doomed anyway!	Otis.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	35811	Otis, the authorities have reconsidered your case and decided that you should go free.	Otis.yack	101
OTIS	35812	I'm very grateful to “the authorities,” and will not mention their name should any awkward questions be asked.	Otis.yack	102
OTIS	35818	Good luck, Stan, I hope you get acquitted!	Otis.yack	120
STAN	35819	Oh, it's in the bag, friend, but thanks!	Otis.yack	127		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	35820	{happy}Otis, old pal. You haven't changed much, have you?	Otis.yack	142
OTIS	35821	I blame the government.	Otis.yack	143
GUYBRUSH	35822	In fact, didn't we first meet right here?	Otis.yack	144
OTIS	35823	The jail was in better shape then.	Otis.yack	145
GUYBRUSH	35824	Otis, Otis, Otis. What are we going to do with you.	Otis.yack	149
OTIS	35825	I didn't do anything this time. I was framed.	Otis.yack	151
OTIS	35826	I'm moving up in the world. I'm back in the luxury cell.	Otis.yack	153
OTIS	35827	This one is two inches wider, and comes with an extra rat.	Otis.yack	154
GUYBRUSH	35828	Where's Stan?	Otis.yack	158
GUYBRUSH	35829	Did they let him go?	Otis.yack	159
OTIS	35830	No. Stan got sentenced to hard time. Did you know he was representing himself?	Otis.yack	160
GUYBRUSH	35831	I've heard that's unwise.	Otis.yack	161
OTIS	35832	They took him to the ice quarry on Brrr Muda.	Otis.yack	162
GUYBRUSH	35833	I hope no one was in the other cell.	Otis.yack	165
OTIS	35834	I was in the other cell.	Otis.yack	166
OTIS	35835	Stan used to be in this one, but he got sentenced to hard time.	Otis.yack	167
OTIS	35836	They took him to the ice quarry on Brrr Muda.	Otis.yack	168
GUYBRUSH	35837	Where did you say Stan is?	Otis.yack	171
OTIS	35838	They took him to the ice quarry on Brrr Muda.	Otis.yack	172
GUYBRUSH	35839	What did you do to get arrested this time?	Otis.yack	174
OTIS	35840	Nothing!	Otis.yack	175
OTIS	35841	I was just standing there. Minding my own business.	Otis.yack	176
OTIS	35842	Applying for earthquake relief.	Otis.yack	177
OTIS	35843	Did you know you're only allowed to do that once?	Otis.yack	178
GUYBRUSH	35844	There is no justice.	Otis.yack	179
GUYBRUSH	35845	What did you do to get arrested this time?	Otis.yack	180
GUYBRUSH	40672	I notice you didn't say what crime they locked you up for.	Otis.yack	181
GUYBRUSH	35847	Picking flowers from the governor's garden sounds like an unwise choice.	Otis.yack	182
GUYBRUSH	35848	Are you worried the rest of the building will cave in?	Otis.yack	183
OTIS	35849	Yes!	Otis.yack	184
OTIS	35850	You think you could spring me?	Otis.yack	185
OTIS	35851	You think you could spring me again?	Otis.yack	186
GUYBRUSH	35852	I doubt it. It looks like something happened to the serial number on this lock.	Otis.yack	191
GUYBRUSH	35853	I'd like you to tell the museum curator about our jailbreak all those years ago.	Otis.yack	196
GUYBRUSH	35854	The one with the mugs of grog.	Otis.yack	197
GUYBRUSH	35855	He doesn't seem to have the story quite right.	Otis.yack	198
OTIS	35856	Of course, the truth is important.	Otis.yack	199
OTIS	35857	When I am free again I will pay him a visit.	Otis.yack	200
GUYBRUSH	35858	Well, I don't see that happening any time soon.	Otis.yack	201
GUYBRUSH	35859	Let's visit again soon.	Otis.yack	203
OTIS	35860	Have your people call my people.	Otis.yack	204
HOVER	11190	Back to the dock	OuterDock.dinky	110
GUYBRUSH	32148	I better take off this voodoo eyepatch first.	OuterDock.dinky	119
GUYBRUSH	32149	I better take off this eyepatch first.	OuterDock.dinky	126
HOVER	11191	Job openings?	OuterDock.dinky	142

GUYBRUSH	32152	How clever.	OuterDock.dinky	166
HOVER	11193	Grog?	OuterDock.dinky	176
GUYBRUSH	32153	I hope this isn't one of those party cruises.	OuterDock.dinky	178
HOVER	11194	Supplies?	OuterDock.dinky	184
GUYBRUSH	32154	Say what you want about my evil horrible nemesis LeChuck, but he does know how to stock a ship.	OuterDock.dinky	186
HOVER	11195	Supplies?	OuterDock.dinky	192
GUYBRUSH	32155	Looks like this is going to be a long journey.	OuterDock.dinky	194

BOYBRUSH	33234	Hey, Dad.	Park.dinky	62
CHUCKIE	33235	Hello, Mr. Threepwood.	Park.dinky	64		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33236	Hey, kids! Having fun?	Park.dinky	66
BOYBRUSH	33237	Yeah!	Park.dinky	68
CHUCKIE	33238	We got Scurvydogs!	Park.dinky	70
DEE	38885	Those have toenails and stuff in them. Blech! I read about it.	Park.dinky	75		UPDATE
BOYBRUSH	33239	{enthusiastic}And we were playing your adventures! We just did Big Whoop.	Park.dinky	77
GUYBRUSH	33240	Big Whoop! Oh boy, that takes me back.	Park.dinky	79
BOYBRUSH	33241	I like it when Chuckie asks me to put his leg back on. He says it really funny!	Park.dinky	82		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33242	You guys always make up the craziest stuff for the ending of that story.	Park.dinky	84
BOYBRUSH	33243	It's fun!	Park.dinky	87
GUYBRUSH	33244	But you can't just change it around! That's not how storytelling works.	Park.dinky	89
BOYBRUSH	33245	{confused}A lot of your stories don't feel like they're finished at the end.	Park.dinky	94
GUYBRUSH	33246	What do you mean?	Park.dinky	96
BOYBRUSH	33247	Well, like, there's this one that you call The Secret of Monkey Island, where you went to Monkey Island and fought LeChuck.	Park.dinky	98		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33248	That story has a great ending! There's punching and fireworks. I thought you liked that one?	Park.dinky	100
BOYBRUSH	33249	{cross}But you never did find The Secret. Not the real one.	Park.dinky	103		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	38886	Sure, but that's not what that story was about.	Park.dinky	113
GUYBRUSH	38887	Kids, let me tell you a story that IS about finding The Secret of Monkey Island.	Park.dinky	118
DEE	38888	Is this a long story?	Park.dinky	121
CHUCKIE	33252	I think maybe I gotta go use the bathroom or something.	Park.dinky	123
DEE	38889	Yeah, I have to go, um, walk my tarantula.	Park.dinky	125
BOYBRUSH	38890	Maybe I should go with them.	Park.dinky	127
GUYBRUSH	38891	No, no, stick around, this is a good one.	Park.dinky	132
GUYBRUSH	33254	See, there was a rumor going around that my old nemesis, LeChuck, had somehow discovered the exact location of The Secret of Monkey Island.	Park.dinky	136
GUYBRUSH	33255	I knew I had to get it before he did, so I went to Mêlée to get my own expedition started and beat him to the punch!	Park.dinky	138
BOYBRUSH	38547	Excuse me.	ParkCouple.yack	11
PARKFEMALE	38548	Would you boys mind letting us enjoy our day in peace? Thanks.	ParkCouple.yack	18
PARKFEMALE	38549	Yes?	ParkCouple.yack	22
BOYBRUSH	38550	Could we have some of your bread to feed the duck?	ParkCouple.yack	24
PARKFEMALE	38551	I don't think so. We brought it for ourselves.	ParkCouple.yack	25
BOYBRUSH	38552	Will you pretend to be our parents again?	ParkCouple.yack	26
PARKFEMALE	38553	What do you mean “again”?	ParkCouple.yack	27
PARKMALE	38554	Run along and find your real parents.	ParkCouple.yack	28
BOYBRUSH	40815	Never mind.	ParkCouple.yack	29

GUYBRUSH	40607	{small_arm_move}Elaine! Thank goodness you're here!	Part5.yack	14
ELAINE	40608	Of course. Where else would I be?	Part5.yack	15
GUYBRUSH	40609	{shrug}I'm not sure where I am all of a sudden.	Part5.yack	17
ELAINE	40610	You're right here with me! But we shouldn't stick around too long.	Part5.yack	18
GUYBRUSH	40611	{upset}I was just underground on Monkey Island and now we're on Mêlée?	Part5.yack	20
ELAINE	40612	Things just go by in a blur sometimes when you're having fun, don't they?	Part5.yack	21
GUYBRUSH	40864	I got The Secret.	Part5.yack	27
ELAINE	40865	You already said that.	Part5.yack	28
GUYBRUSH	40866	I guess I did.	Part5.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	40618	{point_self}I got The Secret!	Part5.yack	30
ELAINE	40619	You finally did it! I hope it was worth it.	Part5.yack	31
GUYBRUSH	40620	I'm going to have to think about that.	Part5.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	40621	How'd it go with Flair?	Part5.yack	34
ELAINE	40622	Let's just say I made my point.	Part5.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	40623	{question}How did you get here before me?	Part5.yack	37
ELAINE	40624	You know I always try to stay a step ahead.	Part5.yack	38
GUYBRUSH	40625	{whoa}Have you done something new with your hair?	Part5.yack	40
ELAINE	40626	It got ruffled in the fight.	Part5.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	40627	I like it.	Part5.yack	42
GUYBRUSH	40706	[silent]I'm ready to go.	Part5.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	40707	I'm going to look around some more.	Part5.yack	45
GUYBRUSH	40708	{small_arm_move}I'm ready to go.	Part5.yack	49
ELAINE	40709	Don't forget to shut off all the lights.	Part5.yack	50
ELAINE	40635	Good. Me too.	Part5.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	40867	Dang, Stan makes LeChuck better every time.	Part5.yack	78
GUYBRUSH	40868	Good thing LeChuck didn't find The Secret first.	Part5.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	40869	(slight laugh)I don't think it's his size.	Part5.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	40870	Each time I come here, Stan really ups the challenge.	Part5.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	40871	But it's still LeChuck zero, Guybrush Threepwood six.	Part5.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	40872	Not this time, my old nemesis. 	Part5.yack	87
LECHUCK	40638	<tinny>The Secret is mine!	Part5.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	40873	Nice twist adding in Madison, Trent, and Lila.	Part5.yack	89
GUYBRUSH	40874	The team-up had me fooled for a while.	Part5.yack	90
LECHUCK	40640	<tinny>The Secret is mine!	Part5.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	40875	Well, back to my boring flooring inspector job.	Part5.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	40876	Until next time.	Part5.yack	94
LECHUCK	40646	<tinny>The Secret is mine!	Part5.yack	100
OTIS	40647	<tinny>You gotta get me out of here!	Part5.yack	109
OTIS	40648	<tinny>It was nothing. I was just picking some flowers.	Part5.yack	110
OTIS	40649	<tinny>I didn't do anything this time. I was framed.	Part5.yack	111
OTIS	40650	<tinny>I blame the government.	Part5.yack	112
OTIS	40651	<tinny>I'm a victim of circumstance.	Part5.yack	113
FISHMONGER	40652	<tinny>Fish! We have fresh fish!	Part5.yack	125
FISHMONGER	40653	<tinny>I presume you want to tell us a story, but I can also tell just by looking at you that you're not ready for the likes of us.	Part5.yack	126		UPDATE
FISHMONGER	40654	<tinny>Aye, that was an absolute ripper! I hereby declare you the winner!	Part5.yack	127
FISHMONGER	40655	<tinny>They'll have fishing lures just like yours.	Part5.yack	128
FISHMONGER	40656	<tinny>Bite yer tongue! That's property of the Chums!	Part5.yack	129

GUYBRUSH	33271	Elaine and Stan are busy talking. I'll try another time.	PictureHelpers.dinky	70
ELAINE	38894	(joking)That must be from some crazy marketing promotion of Stan's.	PictureHelpers.dinky	75
ELAINE	40861	My mighty pirate.	PictureHelpers.dinky	75
ELAINE	33273	How sweet, you put the painting of us back together again! I think you should keep it.	PictureHelpers.dinky	78
ELAINE	40862	The mighty pirate power couple.	PictureHelpers.dinky	78
ELAINE	40863	Nice souvenir of our adventures.	PictureHelpers.dinky	80
ELAINE	33274	I have no idea who that is. I guess I did have my portrait painted with a lot of people while I was governor.	PictureHelpers.dinky	81
ELAINE	33275	Nice picture, who is that with you?	PictureHelpers.dinky	84
ELAINE	33276	Hey, it's a picture of me and Stan!	PictureHelpers.dinky	87
ELAINE	33277	Why are you showing me this picture of Stan with a weaselly-looking guy?	PictureHelpers.dinky	90
ELAINE	33278	Hey, it's a picture of you and Stan!	PictureHelpers.dinky	93
ELAINE	33279	I have no idea who it is. I guess I did have my portrait painted with a lot of people while I was governor.	PictureHelpers.dinky	96		UPDATE
ELAINE	33280	Nice picture, who is that with you?	PictureHelpers.dinky	99
ELAINE	33281	I don't know these people.	PictureHelpers.dinky	102
ELAINE	33282	It's Stan and... somebody.	PictureHelpers.dinky	105
ELAINE	38895	Nice likeness of Stan.	PictureHelpers.dinky	108
ELAINE	38896	Such a cutie!	PictureHelpers.dinky	111
ELAINE	38897	Should I be worried you're carrying around a painting of someone that looks like an accountant?	PictureHelpers.dinky	114
ELAINE	38898	(laughing)Oh, ha ha. You're thinking of becoming an accountant?	PictureHelpers.dinky	117		UPDATE
ELAINE	33272	That's part of that picture of us!	PictureHelpers.dinky	120
ELAINE	31058	(joking)Thanks, I've already got a husband.	PictureHelpers.dinky	123
GUYBRUSH	33283	I don't think they want to see this.	PictureHelpers.dinky	126
GUARD	33287	That looks like you with the former governor of Mêlée Island. Congratulations?	PictureHelpers.dinky	134
GUARD	33288	What's Governor Marley doing with that scrawny guy? She could do better.	PictureHelpers.dinky	137
GUARD	33289	Nice painting. Of the other guy, at least.	PictureHelpers.dinky	140
GUARD	33290	Hey, that's Prisoner Stan with the famous Governor Marley! I didn't know he was such a player.	PictureHelpers.dinky	144
GUARD	33291	Who's the guy next to Stan? We have more room in the prison.	PictureHelpers.dinky	148
GUARD	33292	It's Governor Marley with a pasty-faced boy. So?	PictureHelpers.dinky	159
GUARD	33293	That's you with a pasty-faced boy. Oh, sorry, he's probably your son or something.	PictureHelpers.dinky	162
GUARD	33294	It's a picture of a pasty bald boy and a less pasty bald man. If they're supposed to be famous I don't recognize them.	PictureHelpers.dinky	165
GUARD	33295	Those are two very sinister-looking people.	PictureHelpers.dinky	168
GUARD	33284	That's Governor Marley! I don't like her lime policies.	PictureHelpers.dinky	171
GUARD	33285	That's Prisoner Stan! Anyone could get a picture of him. It doesn't prove anything.	PictureHelpers.dinky	175		UPDATE
GUARD	33286	That's Prisoner Stan!	PictureHelpers.dinky	177
GUARD	31059	All I see is a future inmate.	PictureHelpers.dinky	181
GUARD	33296	That's a good likeness.	PictureHelpers.dinky	184
GUARD	33297	Yeah, so?	PictureHelpers.dinky	186
STAN	33299	{look_left}Is that a wedding photo? It's oozing with marketable charm.	PictureHelpers.dinky	193
STAN	33300	{look_left}Funny I don't remember sitting for that painting.	PictureHelpers.dinky	196
STAN	33298	{look_left}That's my old accountant, Ned Filigree. Genius with figures, but if they ever saw his records...	PictureHelpers.dinky	199
STAN	33301	{look_left}I'd have to check, but I'm sure Elaine's Q score is through the roof.	PictureHelpers.dinky	202
STAN	38899	{look_left}I hope you found that washed up on a beach.	PictureHelpers.dinky	205
STAN	33302	{look_left}Handsome devil, if I don't say so myself.	PictureHelpers.dinky	208
STAN	33303	{look_left}Nice picture. Not sure why you're showing it to me?	PictureHelpers.dinky	210
JUDGE	33304	The submitted evidence is incompetent due to aforementioned verdict having been rendered by this court.	PictureHelpers.dinky	216
JUDGE	33305	{banging_gavel}Order, order in the court.	PictureHelpers.dinky	223
JUDGE	33306	The court has previously recognized Ned's depth of knowledge in accounting.	PictureHelpers.dinky	225
JUDGE	33307	Do not waste the court's time by submitting redundant evidence.	PictureHelpers.dinky	227
JUDGE	33308	{banging_gavel}Order, order in the court. I will have order!	PictureHelpers.dinky	232
JUDGE	33309	Do not waste this court's time by submitting incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial evidence.	PictureHelpers.dinky	234
NED	33310	I admit it. I know Stan. So what of it? You can't prove anything.	PictureHelpers.dinky	242
NED	38900	Where did you get my accounting license?	PictureHelpers.dinky	245
NED	33311	No comment.	PictureHelpers.dinky	247
GUYBRUSH	36203	{confused}I'm a little surprised to hear this.	Plan.yack	8
FLAIRGOREY	36204	You shouldn't be, but so far you haven't struck me as the brightest candle in the box.	Plan.yack	11
GUYBRUSH	36205	{confused}What do you mean you don't want to go to Monkey Island?	Plan.yack	12
FLAIRGOREY	36206	It's not a cryptic metaphor, swabbie. We mean we don't want to go.	Plan.yack	15
GUYBRUSH	36207	{confused}Why wouldn't you want to go to Monkey Island?	Plan.yack	16
FLAIRGOREY	36208	A better question is why WOULD we want to go?	Plan.yack	19
GUYBRUSH	36209	{confused}I thought the whole point of this voyage was to go to Monkey Island?	Plan.yack	20
IRONROSE	36210	It was.	Plan.yack	23
FLAIRGOREY	36211	But that was strictly LeChuck's idea.	Plan.yack	24
GUYBRUSH	36212	The Secret is worth a ton of money!	Plan.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	36213	Probably.	Plan.yack	31
GUYBRUSH	36214	To the right people.	Plan.yack	32
IRONROSE	36215	Let us know if you find any of those people.	Plan.yack	33
GUYBRUSH	36216	The Secret is worth more than mere money!	Plan.yack	34
FLAIRGOREY	36217	Spoken like someone not in need of money.	Plan.yack	35

DEE	38857	[low]Did you know that anchors originally weren't designed to hold ships in place?	Playground.dinky	724
DEE	38858	[low]They were used in combat, shot from cannons as a grapple when you were trying to board another ship.	Playground.dinky	725
DEE	38859	[low]They started making them bigger and bigger because they would do more damage that way.	Playground.dinky	726
DEE	38860	[low]Then people noticed what happened when you missed the other ship and hit the sea bottom instead.	Playground.dinky	727
DEE	38861	[low]The current bow-shaped design is actually less effective than the sharper, v-shaped design that was popular last century.	Playground.dinky	728
DEE	38862	[low]But, the older design went out of fashion after sailors started to think the letter v was bad luck.	Playground.dinky	729
DEE	38863	[low]You can still find the old kind around sometimes but collectors have grabbed most of them.	Playground.dinky	730
DEE	38864	[low]On a modern anchor, if you look close you can tell that one side is a little larger than the other.	Playground.dinky	731
DEE	38865	[low]That's to prevent what's called “plummeting,” where the anchor goes down too evenly and then it doesn't catch well on the bottom.	Playground.dinky	732
DEE	38866	[low]The little flanges at the tips are at different angles to make it twist on the way down, for the same reason.	Playground.dinky	733
DEE	38867	[low]Most anchors these days are made of iron, and you have to recast them like twice a year because they rust.	Playground.dinky	734
DEE	38868	[low]About thirty years ago somebody thought of a way to get around that by making them out of wood instead.	Playground.dinky	735
DEE	38869	[low]All kinds of people invested a lot of money in these wooden anchor companies.	Playground.dinky	736
DEE	38870	[low]But the only way they could keep them from floating was to attach another anchor, and so they gave up and went back to the old way.	Playground.dinky	737
DEE	38871	[low]The word “anchor” comes from the Sanskrit word “nagara,” meaning “city.”	Playground.dinky	738
DEE	38872	[low]They're called that because when you stop in the middle of the ocean it's like you've made port at an invisible city.	Playground.dinky	739
DEE	38873	[low]Yeah, I'm kind of an expert on anchors. I read a lot.	Playground.dinky	740
BOYBRUSH	33205	That's a cool anchor!	Playground.dinky	746
DEE	38874	[low]That just shows how little you know about anchors. This one's not a very good example. You'd know that if you'd read as much about anchors as I have.	Playground.dinky	751

GUYBRUSH	33498	Okay.	PreviouslyOn.yack	19
GUYBRUSH	33499	I had come to Mêlée Island to start an expedition to find The Secret of Monkey Island.	PreviouslyOn.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	38903	But the obnoxious new pirate leaders there wouldn't back me.	PreviouslyOn.yack	31
GUYBRUSH	38904	It looked like I might have to steal a ship instead of hiring one.	PreviouslyOn.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	33502	I was after The Secret of Monkey Island. And I decided that the easiest path to the island was to sign on to crew on LeChuck's ship. I would mount a mutiny at some convenient time.	PreviouslyOn.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	33503	There were two problems. I needed a mop to get the job, and, they knew who I was.	PreviouslyOn.yack	42
GUYBRUSH	33504	I managed to disguise myself so they wouldn't recognize me, but I still needed a mop to secure a position as a swabbie.	PreviouslyOn.yack	43		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33505	I had built myself a mop so I could get a swabbie job, but I was blacklisted, they wouldn't hire me as long as I was me.	PreviouslyOn.yack	44

GUYBRUSH	33514	I had joined LeChuck's crew in disguise. The magic potion that would have taken us to Monkey Island had been ruined.	PreviouslyOn.yack	63
GUYBRUSH	33515	But, Captain Madison and her cronies were nearby in another ship, also bound for the island.	PreviouslyOn.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	33516	I planned to follow them, but the crew were voting against me, and I had to persuade each and every one of them to vote on my side.	PreviouslyOn.yack	66
GUYBRUSH	33517	I planned to follow them, and I had the support of the crew, but I needed to call a formal vote to make it official.	PreviouslyOn.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	38905	We planned to follow Captain Madison's ship instead, but I still needed one thing: LeChuck's map to The Secret. I would have to steal it.	PreviouslyOn.yack	69
GUYBRUSH	33519	I had joined LeChuck's crew in disguise. We were all set to follow Captain Madison's ship to Monkey Island, and now, I had the only map to The Secret.	PreviouslyOn.yack	71		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33520	But Madison's magic potion still needed one ingredient: a flattened skull. I just had to get it to her.	PreviouslyOn.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	38906	Remember I joined LeChuck's crew so I could get to Monkey Island.	PreviouslyOn.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	38907	I got found out at the last minute, and LeChuck threw me off the ship.	PreviouslyOn.yack	78
GUYBRUSH	33528	But, it was only going to be a short walk to Monkey Island, and I had LeChuck's map to The Secret in my pocket!	PreviouslyOn.yack	79
GUYBRUSH	33529	But I simply walked to shore, and now I was on Monkey Island with LeChuck's map to The Secret in my pocket!	PreviouslyOn.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	33531	I was on Monkey Island, and I had made a bargain with my enemies: Captain Madison and her two shifty friends.	PreviouslyOn.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	38908	We had a map to The Secret of Monkey Island, but it was hidden by a security spell, and we needed LeChuck's personal secrets to reveal it.	PreviouslyOn.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	38909	I had found those secrets.	PreviouslyOn.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	33533	Soon there was going to be a race to see who could betray the others the fastest.	PreviouslyOn.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	33537	Captain Madison and her friends betrayed me before I could betray them, and they kicked me off a cliff.	PreviouslyOn.yack	87
GUYBRUSH	33538	Which hurt, but, I had the true map at last, and now I knew that The Secret of Monkey Island had been in the Voodoo Shop on Mêlée Island all along!	PreviouslyOn.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	33539	And, Elaine arrived just at the right time to help me get there!	PreviouslyOn.yack	89
GUYBRUSH	33540	We were about to fix up my old ship, the Sea Monkey, and sail to Mêlée together!	PreviouslyOn.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	38910	So I learned that The Secret of Monkey Island was inside the Voodoo Shop on Mêlée all along.	PreviouslyOn.yack	99
GUYBRUSH	38911	Elaine and I had just arrived, hoping to beat LeChuck and Captain Madison to the punch.	PreviouslyOn.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	38912	Elaine had to run off because people needed help after the earthquake, but I was on my way to the Voodoo Shop.	PreviouslyOn.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	38913	Now I was at the Voodoo Shop. Surprisingly, there was no sign of LeChuck, or Madison.	PreviouslyOn.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	38914	But The Secret was there, inside of a big safe with five keyholes. I was going to need some keys.	PreviouslyOn.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	38915	So The Secret of Monkey Island was in a safe at the Voodoo Shop.	PreviouslyOn.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	38916	And I was looking for the five Golden Keys that would open it.	PreviouslyOn.yack	108
GUYBRUSH	38917	I had found one key so far.	PreviouslyOn.yack	109
GUYBRUSH	38918	I had managed to find two keys and was working on the other three.	PreviouslyOn.yack	110
GUYBRUSH	38919	I already had three, so there were just two keys left to go.	PreviouslyOn.yack	111
GUYBRUSH	38920	I had four of the five!	PreviouslyOn.yack	112
GUYBRUSH	38921	I was well on my way to becoming queen of Brrr Muda.	PreviouslyOn.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	38922	I wasn't sure where LeChuck or Captain Madison were, but I was sure they were up to something.	PreviouslyOn.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	38923	The Voodoo Lady had gone missing.	PreviouslyOn.yack	117
GUYBRUSH	38924	Corina, the Voodoo Lady, had gone missing.	PreviouslyOn.yack	118
GUYBRUSH	38925	Wally, too.	PreviouslyOn.yack	119
GUYBRUSH	38926	Wally, the cartographer, had gone missing.	PreviouslyOn.yack	120
GUYBRUSH	38927	Elaine was setting up disaster relief for earthquake victims.	PreviouslyOn.yack	122
GUYBRUSH	38928	Elaine was on Scurvy Island, working on stuff for the Marley Foundation.	PreviouslyOn.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	38929	Stan was in prison in an ice quarry.	PreviouslyOn.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	38930	I had incidentally become queen of Brrr Muda.	PreviouslyOn.yack	126
GUYBRUSH	38931	There was a lot to think about. But I was keeping my todo list up to date, and the main thing was finding those Golden Keys.	PreviouslyOn.yack	128
GUYBRUSH	38932	Remember I was looking for five Golden Keys, to unlock the safe that was holding The Secret of Monkey Island.	PreviouslyOn.yack	133
GUYBRUSH	38933	I had just found the last one, and now I was on my way to the Voodoo Shop to claim my prize!	PreviouslyOn.yack	134
GUYBRUSH	38934	I found them all, and now I was at the Voodoo Shop, about to open the safe and claim my prize!	PreviouslyOn.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	38935	Remember LeChuck stole the chest with The Secret in it.	PreviouslyOn.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	38936	He took it to Monkey Island, where he planned to open it, and Elaine and I followed him.	PreviouslyOn.yack	141
GUYBRUSH	38937	Flair Gorey tried to stop us, but Elaine held her off while I went down under the monkey head after LeChuck.	PreviouslyOn.yack	142
GUYBRUSH	38940	I found a great big lava chamber that felt like the end of the trail, but there was no sign of LeChuck or the chest.	PreviouslyOn.yack	145
GUYBRUSH	38941	Remember LeChuck stole the chest with The Secret and I followed him to Monkey Island and under the giant monkey head.	PreviouslyOn.yack	148
GUYBRUSH	38942	But something strange was going on.	PreviouslyOn.yack	149
GUYBRUSH	38943	Hundreds of feet underground, there was a doorway that somehow led out into an alley that I thought I remembered being on Mêlée Island.	PreviouslyOn.yack	150
GUYBRUSH	38944	I went through this door and found myself on High Street in Mêlée town.	PreviouslyOn.yack	151		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	38945	And everybody was all weird and mechanical. Except for Stan and Elaine.	PreviouslyOn.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	33541	Now back to the story...	PreviouslyOn.yack	158
GUYBRUSH	38262	You wouldn't happen to have a magic voodoo concoction in here that will get us to Monkey Island, would you?	Putra.yack	23
PUTRA	38263	No. And like Rose said, we used up most of the supplies, so there's no way we're brewing another one.	Putra.yack	24
GUYBRUSH	38264	Okay, just checking. I'll find a different way.	Putra.yack	25
GUYBRUSH	38265	I've got an idea for how we can get to Monkey Island after all!	Putra.yack	29
PUTRA	38266	Good for you, swabbie. You should take that straight to the top.	Putra.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	38267	LeChuck!	Putra.yack	31
PUTRA	38268	Of course not. I mean Iron Rose.	Putra.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	38269	Right, good thinking.	Putra.yack	33
GUYBRUSH	38270	So, Putra...	Putra.yack	41
PUTRA	38271	{almost_money}CHEF Putra. Please call me Chef. Everybody does.	Putra.yack	42
GUYBRUSH	38272	They do?	Putra.yack	43
PUTRA	38273	No. Never. But they should.	Putra.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	38274	So, Chef...	Putra.yack	46
GUYBRUSH	38275	I'd like to try to sway you on the Monkey Island vote.	Putra.yack	52
GUYBRUSH	38276	And I won't even bring up the fact that you kind of owe me one.	Putra.yack	53
GUYBRUSH	38277	I'm above that.	Putra.yack	54
PUTRA	38278	Save your breath, I'm unswayable.	Putra.yack	55
PUTRA	38279	There's only one opinion I value and that's Iron Rose's, she's the smartest one on the ship.	Putra.yack	56
GUYBRUSH	38280	{point_up}Second smartest.	Putra.yack	57
PUTRA	38281	Now that you mention it, I'm remembering that I said just last week that I'd always vote with Rose.	Putra.yack	58
PUTRA	38282	So I'm gonna do that on this, too. Whatever way Rose votes, that's how I'll vote.	Putra.yack	59
PUTRA	38283	Thanks for reminding me!	Putra.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	38284	Great!	Putra.yack	63
GUYBRUSH	38285	(disappointed)Oh.	Putra.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	38286	You sure I can't change your mind on the Monkey Island issue?	Putra.yack	68
PUTRA	38287	Yeah, I'm voting whatever way Rose votes.	Putra.yack	69
PUTRA	38288	I do owe you one, but I'm still voting whatever way Rose votes.	Putra.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	38289	Okay.	Putra.yack	71
GUYBRUSH	38290	I just want to confirm your vote on going to Monkey Island.	Putra.yack	73
PUTRA	38291	I'll be for it if Rose is for it.	Putra.yack	74
GUYBRUSH	38292	Okay.	Putra.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	38293	{proud}I got LeChuck to authorize your promotion.	Putra.yack	77
PUTRA	38294	What?	Putra.yack	78
GUYBRUSH	38295	How come people don't call you chef?	Putra.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	38296	I don't suppose you know how to make Scorched Alaska?	Putra.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	38297	Are you sure you don't want to make a Scorched Alaska?	Putra.yack	87
PUTRA	38298	Like I said, Scorched Alaska calls for a CHEF.	Putra.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	38299	Now that you're a chef, would you make me a Scorched Alaska?	Putra.yack	91
PUTRA	38300	Of course.	Putra.yack	92
GUYBRUSH	38301	What exactly is a Scorched Alaska?	Putra.yack	94
PUTRA	38302	Imagine a dessert shaped like a huge, legless jellyfish, with a texture like ice cream wrapped in packing foam, and it sets your face on fire when you eat it.	Putra.yack	95
GUYBRUSH	38303	{whoa}Appetizing.	Putra.yack	96
PUTRA	38304	Not really.	Putra.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	38305	Did you know Gullet well?	Putra.yack	99
PUTRA	38306	Sure. He and I were the only zombies in the crew until you came along.	Putra.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	38307	I'll let you get back to cooking.	Putra.yack	102
PUTRA	38308	Yeah.	Putra.yack	103
PUTRA	38309	{almost_money}Because they're a bunch of pedestrian clods who wouldn't know a great meal if it hit them in the mouth.	Putra.yack	108
PUTRA	38310	Which, by the way, it often does, if you cook it right.	Putra.yack	109
GUYBRUSH	38311	{small_arm_move}Or wrong.	Putra.yack	110
PUTRA	38312	But mainly it's because technically I AM a cook, not a chef. It's a job title.	Putra.yack	111
GUYBRUSH	38313	So a chef is better than a cook?	Putra.yack	114
PUTRA	38314	Not necessarily, I mean, a good cook makes better food than a lousy chef.	Putra.yack	115
PUTRA	38315	But being a cook is mostly about mastery of materials and technique, whereas a chef adds artistry, improvisation, and innovation.	Putra.yack	116
PUTRA	38316	Anyone who's tasted my boiled monkfish and haggis dumplings SHOULD agree that I deserve that title.	Putra.yack	117
GUYBRUSH	38317	So a chef outranks a cook?	Putra.yack	119
PUTRA	38318	Yeah.	Putra.yack	120
PUTRA	38319	Of course on a ship this size I'd still be the only one making food, so that part doesn't mean anything.	Putra.yack	121
PUTRA	38320	It's just about the recognition.	Putra.yack	122
GUYBRUSH	38321	Does a chef get paid more than a cook?	Putra.yack	124
PUTRA	38322	Hah!	Putra.yack	125
PUTRA	38323	I mean yes, but on this ship? Not enough to make a difference.	Putra.yack	126
PUTRA	38324	{almost_money}It's the principle of the thing.	Putra.yack	127
GUYBRUSH	38325	{small_arm_move}Have you tried to get a promotion?	Putra.yack	129
PUTRA	38326	Only about a dozen times!	Putra.yack	132
PUTRA	38327	I keep the written request handy, complete with case studies and cost benefit analysis.	Putra.yack	133
PUTRA	38328	There is absolutely nothing wrong with this!	Putra.yack	134
PUTRA	38329	But, LeChuck refuses to sign it.	Putra.yack	150
GUYBRUSH	38330	{shake_head}Management. Pft.	Putra.yack	151
PUTRA	38331	Yeah.	Putra.yack	152
PUTRA	38332	Of course I can make Scorched Alaska!	Putra.yack	158
PUTRA	38333	But I'm not going to.	Putra.yack	160
GUYBRUSH	38334	Why not?	Putra.yack	161
PUTRA	38335	Scorched Alaska is the kind of thing that requires a skilled CHEF.	Putra.yack	162
PUTRA	38336	Apparently I'm still only a COOK.	Putra.yack	163
GUYBRUSH	38337	{whoa}I wasn't aware there was a difference.	Putra.yack	166
PUTRA	38338	That's because you're an ignorant clod like everyone else on this ship.	Putra.yack	167
GUYBRUSH	38339	{slow_nod}I see.	Putra.yack	170
GUYBRUSH	38340	I see.	Putra.yack	174
GUYBRUSH	38341	{proud}I got LeChuck to authorize your promotion.	Putra.yack	175
PUTRA	38342	What?	Putra.yack	176
PUTRA	38343	I have to warn you though, not to try to eat it.	Putra.yack	185
PUTRA	38344	I have to warn you, though, it's not going to be very spicy.	Putra.yack	187
GUYBRUSH	38345	Because of the Demon Pepper?	Putra.yack	209
PUTRA	38346	Mostly.	Putra.yack	210
PUTRA	38347	You've still got a fair amount of your face left, it'd be a shame to melt it off prematurely.	Putra.yack	211
GUYBRUSH	38348	Why is that?	Putra.yack	223
PUTRA	38349	I'm totally out of Demon Pepper.	Putra.yack	224
PUTRA	38350	It'll be fine, you wouldn't like the full strength version anyway.	Putra.yack	225
PUTRA	38351	Some chefs these days use dandruff out of a can, but I would never take a shortcut like that.	Putra.yack	233
PUTRA	38352	One Scorched Alaska, made to order! Be careful with it, and like I said, don't try to eat it.	Putra.yack	243
PUTRA	38353	One Scorched Alaska, extra mild!	Putra.yack	244
GUYBRUSH	38354	Thanks!	Putra.yack	245
GUYBRUSH	38355	Sometimes I forget I'm a zombie.	Putra.yack	250
PUTRA	38356	I don't.	Putra.yack	251
PUTRA	38357	Every time I try to get a decent cooking job at a restaurant or some swanky manor house...	Putra.yack	252
PUTRA	38358	{almost_money}They say I'm “too green,” and they play it off like they're talking about experience level but I know what they mean.	Putra.yack	253
PUTRA	38359	Zombies need not apply. We don't want 'em rotting near the food.	Putra.yack	254
PUTRA	38360	You must have experiences like that.	Putra.yack	255
GUYBRUSH	38361	How did you become a zombie?	Putra.yack	257
PUTRA	38362	Oh, the usual way.	Putra.yack	258
PUTRA	38363	I was at the culinary academy at the time.	Putra.yack	259
PUTRA	38364	At first I thought I was having an allergic reaction to some strawberries!	Putra.yack	260
PUTRA	38365	Ha ha ha!	Putra.yack	261
GUYBRUSH	38366	(uncertain)Ha ha!	Putra.yack	262
PUTRA	38367	How about you?	Putra.yack	263
GUYBRUSH	38368	{whoa}Me? Um...	Putra.yack	264
GUYBRUSH	38369	What was Gullet like?	Putra.yack	266
PUTRA	38370	Well, you'll have noticed he was a bit of a bully.	Putra.yack	267
GUYBRUSH	38371	Not at all.	Putra.yack	268
PUTRA	38372	He didn't have much power or control in his life, and he was insecure about that.	Putra.yack	269
PUTRA	38373	So he compensated by being domineering, vicious, and cruel whenever he had the opportunity.	Putra.yack	270
GUYBRUSH	38374	You don't say.	Putra.yack	271
PUTRA	38375	But he had his good side.	Putra.yack	272
PUTRA	38376	He wrote poetry. Nobody else knows that, he kept it a secret.	Putra.yack	273		UPDATE
PUTRA	38377	He was always afraid someone would steal his ideas.	Putra.yack	274
PUTRA	39451	Not that anyone would have. His poems were total garbage.	Putra.yack	275
GUYBRUSH	38378	{slow_nod}Aaaanyway...	Putra.yack	277
GUYBRUSH	38379	I'm a zombie by marriage?	Putra.yack	280
PUTRA	38380	Ha ha!	Putra.yack	281
PUTRA	38381	Good one.	Putra.yack	282
PUTRA	38382	I was married once too, I know what you mean.	Putra.yack	283
GUYBRUSH	38383	I was asleep at the time?	Putra.yack	285
PUTRA	38384	That is so, so common.	Putra.yack	286
GUYBRUSH	38385	At first I thought it was a hangover.	Putra.yack	287
PUTRA	38386	Ha ha ha!	Putra.yack	288
GUYBRUSH	38387	I'm allergic to strawberries too.	Putra.yack	290
PUTRA	38388	Oh, I wasn't allergic.	Putra.yack	291
PUTRA	38389	Can't stand 'em now, though, obviously.	Putra.yack	292
GUYBRUSH	38390	Obviously, haha.	Putra.yack	293
GUYBRUSH	38391	Another zombie bit me while trying to eat my brain, of course.	Putra.yack	295
PUTRA	38392	A bite? That old wives' tale?	Putra.yack	296
PUTRA	38393	If you didn't want to tell me you should have just said so.	Putra.yack	297
GUYBRUSH	38394	My birthday party clown gig really dried up.	Putra.yack	301
PUTRA	38395	Imagine thinking zombies are scarier to children than clowns are.	Putra.yack	302
GUYBRUSH	38396	There's no justice.	Putra.yack	303
PUTRA	38397	It's absurd.	Putra.yack	304
GUYBRUSH	38398	My bridge club shunned me.	Putra.yack	306
PUTRA	38399	Unbelievable!	Putra.yack	307
GUYBRUSH	38400	{shrug}I know, it's outrageous.	Putra.yack	308
PUTRA	38401	No I mean you just didn't strike me as a bridge player.	Putra.yack	309
GUYBRUSH	38402	They think all we want to do is eat brains.	Putra.yack	311
PUTRA	38403	Which, to be honest, I do want.	Putra.yack	312
PUTRA	38404	But not constantly. That's a terrible stereotype.	Putra.yack	313
GUYBRUSH	38405	Yes, definitely.	Putra.yack	315
GUYBRUSH	38406	{point}Can I ask about that pepper shaker?	Putra.yack	324
PUTRA	38407	It's Demon Pepper. Made from Demon Peppers, which are basically the hottest peppers you can get.	Putra.yack	327
PUTRA	38408	It was Demon Pepper. Made from Demon Peppers, which are basically the hottest peppers you can get.	Putra.yack	328
PUTRA	38409	{almost_money}Do not, under any circumstances, put it on anything you intend to eat.	Putra.yack	329
GUYBRUSH	38410	{proud}I like spicy food.	Putra.yack	330
PUTRA	38411	Not like this. Burns on the way in, burns on the way out. In between? Burns.	Putra.yack	331
PUTRA	38412	Doesn't matter, though. The shaker's empty, I'm all out.	Putra.yack	332
GUYBRUSH	38413	Remind me what you told me about the pepper?	Putra.yack	336
PUTRA	38414	It's very very very hot.	Putra.yack	338
PUTRA	38415	And very empty.	Putra.yack	339
PUTRA	38416	Gullet, you tough old slab of crocodile meat! Somehow I knew you'd make it back.	Putra.yack	346
PUTRA	38417	Can I fix you something to eat?	Putra.yack	347
GUYBRUSH	38418	{shake_head}No thanks. Not so hungry right now.	Putra.yack	349
PUTRA	38419	Really? I can't remember you ever saying no to food before.	Putra.yack	350
PUTRA	38420	You must have something on your mind, as unlikely as that sounds.	Putra.yack	351
GUYBRUSH	38421	A nice juicy steak?	Putra.yack	353
PUTRA	38422	On this ship? I think your head's taken on too much water.	Putra.yack	354
GUYBRUSH	38423	Plate of brains?	Putra.yack	356
PUTRA	38424	That's my boy. I fixed this for myself, but you can have it.	Putra.yack	357
PUTRA	38425	You can eat while we talk.	Putra.yack	358
GUYBRUSH	38426	I'll have whatever LeChuck's having.	Putra.yack	374
PUTRA	38427	LeChuck's on the island, looking for the big Secret.	Putra.yack	376
GUYBRUSH	38428	You cook for LeChuck. Does he have a favorite dish?	Putra.yack	382
GUYBRUSH	38429	What dish does LeChuck ask you for more than any other?	Putra.yack	383
GUYBRUSH	38430	What was that lovely meal I cleaned up in LeChuck's cabin last night?	Putra.yack	384
GUYBRUSH	38431	What will you cook for LeChuck to celebrate finding The Secret?	Putra.yack	385
GUYBRUSH	38432	Please just tell me LeChuck's favorite food.	Putra.yack	386
GUYBRUSH	38433	Can you make me some tentacles with daisy sauce?	Putra.yack	387
GUYBRUSH	38434	What's that thing LeChuck always says, it's sort of his catchphrase?	Putra.yack	388
PUTRA	38435	“You're a terrible cook, Putra?”	Putra.yack	389
GUYBRUSH	38436	I was thinking more of something he'd use in all kinds of situations.	Putra.yack	390
PUTRA	38437	Then I've got no idea.	Putra.yack	391
GUYBRUSH	38438	Do you happen to know LeChuck's theme song?	Putra.yack	393
PUTRA	38439	I dunno. Flair's the composer.	Putra.yack	394
PUTRA	38440	I think she's on deck duty right now.	Putra.yack	395
GUYBRUSH	38441	No. I mean yes. Sure she is.	Putra.yack	396
GUYBRUSH	38442	You really don't know LeChuck's catchphrase?	Putra.yack	398
PUTRA	38443	Nope.	Putra.yack	399
GUYBRUSH	38444	Welp, I've got work to do.	Putra.yack	401
PUTRA	38445	(skeptical)Right.	Putra.yack	402
PUTRA	38446	Don't tease me by trying to take an interest.	Putra.yack	408
PUTRA	38447	You're just teasing me.	Putra.yack	408
PUTRA	38448	Stop it.	Putra.yack	408
PUTRA	38449	{almost_money}You've never had the slightest appreciation for my talents, you think I just sling hash.	Putra.yack	410
GUYBRUSH	38450	You're the best cook I've ever known.	Putra.yack	412
PUTRA	38451	I got promoted, you ignorant lout!	Putra.yack	413
GUYBRUSH	38452	You're the best chef I've ever known.	Putra.yack	415
GUYBRUSH	38453	You're the best hash slinger I've ever known.	Putra.yack	416
PUTRA	38454	There, you just proved it!	Putra.yack	417
GUYBRUSH	38455	Fine, don't tell me.	Putra.yack	419
PUTRA	38456	Okay.	Putra.yack	420
PUTRA	38457	Get out of my galley!	Putra.yack	424
GUYBRUSH	39452	Ok, I'm going.	Putra.yack	429
PUTRA	38458	Chef! You called me Chef!	Putra.yack	442
PUTRA	38459	In all the years you've known me you've never done that before!	Putra.yack	443
PUTRA	38460	I don't know what happened while you were overboard, but I like this change in you.	Putra.yack	444
PUTRA	38461	Uh... what was it you wanted to know about?	Putra.yack	445
GUYBRUSH	38462	LeChuck's favorite food.	Putra.yack	447
PUTRA	38463	Well that's easy. Tentacles with daisy sauce.	Putra.yack	452
BOYBRUSH	38464	Yech!	Putra.yack	458
GUYBRUSH	38465	Don't blame me, it's not MY favorite food.	Putra.yack	460
BOYBRUSH	38466	Are we almost to the part about the triple-cross?	Putra.yack	462
GUYBRUSH	38467	Almost!	Putra.yack	465
GUYBRUSH	38468	Not quite.	Putra.yack	467
PUTRA	38469	...tentacles with daisy sauce.	Putra.yack	475
GUYBRUSH	38470	Ah. A classic.	Putra.yack	476
GUYBRUSH	38471	Thanks, Chef.	Putra.yack	478
PUTRA	38472	You're welcome!	Putra.yack	479
PUTRA	38473	Sorry. I'm all out of the main ingredient.	Putra.yack	486
PUTRA	38474	I can and I would, but I'm all out of daisies.	Putra.yack	489
PUTRA	38475	That's a nice one!	Putra.yack	519
PUTRA	38476	Nice, they look organic.	Putra.yack	522
PUTRA	38477	Have it for you in a jiff.	Putra.yack	524
PUTRA	38478	Bon appetit.	Putra.yack	553
GUYBRUSH	38479	That's it?	Putra.yack	554
PUTRA	38480	Sometimes simple is best.	Putra.yack	555
GUYBRUSH	38481	Mind if I take that dish of tentacles with me?	Putra.yack	562
PUTRA	38482	Knock yourself out. I did make it for you.	Putra.yack	563
GUYBRUSH	39453	Thanks for the tentacle thing.	Putra.yack	568
PUTRA	39454	No problem. Don't let LeChuck catch you with it.	Putra.yack	569

GUYBRUSH	34284	Permission to come aboard, sir.	Quarantine.yack	25
GUYBRUSH	34285	Yeah, I know. Scurvy. Deadly. Contagious. Quarantined.	Quarantine.yack	26
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34286	Afraid we can't let you do that.	Quarantine.yack	30

QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34288	This isn't a protocol issue.	Quarantine.yack	32
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34289	Although we do enjoy a good protocol.	Quarantine.yack	33
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34290	(miffed)Are you going to let me talk?	Quarantine.yack	34
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34291	(eyeroll)Apparently, that's what you enjoy doing.	Quarantine.yack	35
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34292	There's been a deadly scurvy outbreak on the ship.	Quarantine.yack	36		UPDATE
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34293	We're under strict quarantine so we don't infect others with this deadly pathogen.	Quarantine.yack	37
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34294	Scurvy is deadly and we don't want to infect others.	Quarantine.yack	42
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34295	Scurvy is a painful death, you don't want to catch it.	Quarantine.yack	42
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34296	Scurvy is the new Plague.	Quarantine.yack	42
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34297	Sorry.	Quarantine.yack	43
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34298	You don't know that. My cousin's uncle's mother's best friend says it is.	Quarantine.yack	54
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34299	You don't know that. My friend's nephew's barber's brother says it is.	Quarantine.yack	55
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34300	You don't know that. My mom's gardener's second cousin's pastry chef says it is.	Quarantine.yack	56
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34301	You don't know that. My sister's best friend's dad's dietician says it is.	Quarantine.yack	57
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34302	You don't know that. My best friend's uncle's gardener's dog says it is.	Quarantine.yack	58
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34303	You don't know that. My uncle's best friend's wife's dog walker says it is.	Quarantine.yack	59
GUYBRUSH	34304	[silent]I... Ah... I don't think scurvy is contagious.	Quarantine.yack	61
GUYBRUSH	34305	I don't think scurvy is contagious.	Quarantine.yack	63
GUYBRUSH	34307	It's a scientific fact.	Quarantine.yack	65
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34308	Don't try to snow us with your “science” quackery.	Quarantine.yack	66
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34309	If scurvy wasn't contagious then only one person would have it.	Quarantine.yack	67
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34310	Duh.	Quarantine.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	34311	I really don't think scurvy is contagious.	Quarantine.yack	70
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34312	Peddle your science to someone more gullible.	Quarantine.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	34313	Where'd you get that cool flag with all the holes?	Quarantine.yack	74
GUYBRUSH	34314	Where'd you get that cool flag with the hole?	Quarantine.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	34315	{point}Can I have your flag?	Quarantine.yack	77
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34316	Did you not hear me? Scurvy on board! Quarantine!	Quarantine.yack	78
GUYBRUSH	34317	You could just toss it down to me.	Quarantine.yack	79
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34318	Best not to risk it. It's probably crawling with scurvy, trust me.	Quarantine.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	34319	[silent]You should try limes. They help prevent scurvy.	Quarantine.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	34320	I have some exciting scurvy news for you! Read this.	Quarantine.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	40718	[silent]Have a look at this flyer on limes.	Quarantine.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	34322	Bye, don't let the scurvy bite you.	Quarantine.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	34323	It looks familiar.	Quarantine.yack	88
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34324	We found it floating in the ocean.	Quarantine.yack	89
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34325	It's one of Bella Fisher's flags. She probably lost it when her ship went down.	Quarantine.yack	90
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34326	It's Bella Fisher's flag. She probably lost it when her ship went down.	Quarantine.yack	91
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34327	We're afraid to take it down and offend the scurvy gods.	Quarantine.yack	92
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34328	There is no such thing as the scurvy gods.	Quarantine.yack	93		UPDATE
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34329	Then why is there scurvy? Answer me that.	Quarantine.yack	94
GUYBRUSH	34330	You should try limes. They help prevent scurvy.	Quarantine.yack	105
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34331	Where did you hear that?	Quarantine.yack	115
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34332	Is that more of your “science” mumbo jumbo?	Quarantine.yack	116
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34333	You need to leave before you catch scurvy.	Quarantine.yack	117
GUYBRUSH	40719	Have a look at this flyer on limes.	Quarantine.yack	126
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34335	Hm, ascorbic acid deficiency, collagen synthesis, mucous membranes!	Quarantine.yack	132
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34336	Hey! That is a bunch of science nonsense!	Quarantine.yack	133
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34337	We won't have any of that around here.	Quarantine.yack	134
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34338	It's all a trick to track our plunder.	Quarantine.yack	135
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34339	(underbreath)As if you have any plunder.	Quarantine.yack	136
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34340	You already showed us your lie filled science tomfoolery!	Quarantine.yack	142
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34341	Take your science jibber-jabber and leave before you catch scurvy.	Quarantine.yack	143
GUYBRUSH	40671	I have some exciting scurvy news for you! Read this.	Quarantine.yack	153

QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34349	Have you got any of these miracle Razor Bombs?	Quarantine.yack	170
GUYBRUSH	34350	Sure thing, right here, these little green guys.	Quarantine.yack	171
QUARANTINEDPIRATE1	34351	You're sure there is no science in them?	Quarantine.yack	186
GUYBRUSH	34352	Check the flyer, you won't find a whiff of science!	Quarantine.yack	187
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	34353	We're saved!	Quarantine.yack	201

HOVER	10609	That's a Bella Fisher flag!	QuarantinedShip.dinky	192
HOVER	10610	Old tattered flag	QuarantinedShip.dinky	192
GUYBRUSH	31391	It's seen better days.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	196
GUYBRUSH	31392	It's an old flag with a hole in it.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	199
GUYBRUSH	31393	It's an old flag with a bunch of holes in it.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	201
HOVER	10611	Grab the flag	QuarantinedShip.dinky	213
HOVER	10612	Swap flags	QuarantinedShip.dinky	236
GUYBRUSH	31394	I'd prefer to keep as many of these flags as possible for myself.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	241
GUYBRUSH	31395	I'll just replace it with this one, maybe they won't notice.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	243
HOVER	10613	That's where Bella's flag was!	QuarantinedShip.dinky	263
HOVER	10614	That's my replica flag!	QuarantinedShip.dinky	264
GUYBRUSH	31396	It looks kind of bare up there now.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	268
GUYBRUSH	31397	It looks tiny, I really hope they don't notice.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	270
HOVER	10615	Replace the flag	QuarantinedShip.dinky	281
GUYBRUSH	31398	I'll just replace it with this one, maybe they won't notice.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	284

GUYBRUSH	31400	Hey, Murray.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	360
MURRAY	31401	Have you tried scurvy? It would suit you.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	362
GUYBRUSH	31402	Any other genius ideas?	QuarantinedShip.dinky	364
MURRAY	31403	Hush! I am acting natural.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	366
HOVER	10620	They went that way	QuarantinedShip.dinky	377
GUYBRUSH	31404	I'm sure they won't miss one little flag, but I'd also rather not ask.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	379
HOVER	10621	Thorough signage	QuarantinedShip.dinky	386
GUYBRUSH	31405	The messages are a little mixed, but clearly enthusiastic.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	388
QUARANTINEDPIRATE2	31406	You're welcome! And thank you!	QuarantinedShip.dinky	390
HOVER	10622	Biohazard sign	QuarantinedShip.dinky	396
GUYBRUSH	31407	Biohazards are my least favorite hazards!	QuarantinedShip.dinky	398

GUYBRUSH	31408	I'm sensing a generally negative attitude directed at visitors.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	406

GUYBRUSH	31414	Their ship. Their rules.	QuarantinedShip.dinky	503
GUYBRUSH	36357	How's the potion coming?	Quartermaster.yack	42
PUTRA	36358	You heard the captain. It's nearly finished.	Quartermaster.yack	51
FLAIRGOREY	36359	Go and find a flattened skull, like he told you to.	Quartermaster.yack	52
IRONROSE	36360	If you can't do that, find a regular skull and flatten it.	Quartermaster.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	36361	{point}What's that?	Quartermaster.yack	60
IRONROSE	36362	Plundering prospects.	Quartermaster.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	36363	Aw, you won't need those. I'll find a way for us to get to Monkey Island.	Quartermaster.yack	63
IRONROSE	36364	(sure you will)Mm hm.	Quartermaster.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	36365	Don't look so glum, I'll find us a way to Monkey Island somehow.	Quartermaster.yack	68
IRONROSE	36366	Oh sure, you do that.	Quartermaster.yack	70		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	36367	Listen, about that trip to Monkey Island...	Quartermaster.yack	76
IRONROSE	36368	That we voted against.	Quartermaster.yack	79
GUYBRUSH	36369	Exactly. I want to try to persuade you to change your mind about it.	Quartermaster.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	36370	Or if not your mind, then at least your vote.	Quartermaster.yack	81
IRONROSE	36371	Good luck with that. I'm regretting hiring you right now.	Quartermaster.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	36372	I still think you should vote to go to Monkey Island.	Quartermaster.yack	84
IRONROSE	36373	Why?	Quartermaster.yack	87
IRONROSE	36374	I don't want to talk about that now.	Quartermaster.yack	89
IRONROSE	36375	I'm having a crisis of faith, about not being inspired by LeChuck to follow his lead.	Quartermaster.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	36376	Okay.	Quartermaster.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	36377	I could do you a favor in return. Win-win.	Quartermaster.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	36378	That's how politics works, right?	Quartermaster.yack	98
IRONROSE	36379	I don't bargain away my opinions and judgment for cash or favors, swabbie.	Quartermaster.yack	99
IRONROSE	36380	I'm not for sale. I have a moral center.	Quartermaster.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	36381	{small_shrug}I've got one of those, it's just kind of small and off to the side. Like a hangnail.	Quartermaster.yack	101
IRONROSE	36382	Let's hope it doesn't cause you any trouble in your career as a pirate.	Quartermaster.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	36383	Not so far.	Quartermaster.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	36384	As quartermaster it seems like you should be more loyal to LeChuck.	Quartermaster.yack	105
GUYBRUSH	36385	{small_arm_move}Who, I will point out, very much wants to go.	Quartermaster.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	36386	Aren't you curious about what The Secret might turn out to be?	Quartermaster.yack	108
IRONROSE	36387	Not really, no.	Quartermaster.yack	109
IRONROSE	36388	Most secrets turn out to be either disappointing or disturbing.	Quartermaster.yack	110
IRONROSE	36389	That's why people cover them up in the first place.	Quartermaster.yack	111
GUYBRUSH	36390	Okay, never mind.	Quartermaster.yack	113
IRONROSE	36391	I don't.	Quartermaster.yack	114
IRONROSE	36392	I've been with LeChuck a long time.	Quartermaster.yack	119
GUYBRUSH	36393	{happy}Exactly!	Quartermaster.yack	120
IRONROSE	36394	In the beginning I really admired the way he saw the world.	Quartermaster.yack	121
GUYBRUSH	36395	Through a reddish haze of constant anger?	Quartermaster.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	36396	As his own personal plaything?	Quartermaster.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	36397	As a big round box with a ribbon on it and The Secret of Monkey Island inside?	Quartermaster.yack	125
IRONROSE	36398	I don't know, that's just it.	Quartermaster.yack	128
IRONROSE	36399	I can't even remember what I found so inspiring!	Quartermaster.yack	129
IRONROSE	36400	It makes it hard to follow his lead on a personal quest like The Secret of Monkey Island.	Quartermaster.yack	130
GUYBRUSH	36401	Oh.	Quartermaster.yack	131
GUYBRUSH	36402	{show_document}Do you remember giving me this at my orientation? It's got some good stuff in it.	Quartermaster.yack	138
IRONROSE	36403	Oh yeah...	Quartermaster.yack	140
IRONROSE	36404	I put it together myself, you know.	Quartermaster.yack	141
GUYBRUSH	36405	No kidding?	Quartermaster.yack	142
IRONROSE	36406	Heh. “Betray trust.” “Commit fraud.” “Threaten bodily harm.”	Quartermaster.yack	143
IRONROSE	36407	So unswerving! So unapologetically ruthless! This really takes me back.	Quartermaster.yack	144
GUYBRUSH	36408	Me too! Uh... back to earlier today, in my case.	Quartermaster.yack	145
IRONROSE	36409	LeChuck is really an amazing leader.	Quartermaster.yack	146
GUYBRUSH	36410	You can hang on to that if you like.	Quartermaster.yack	147
IRONROSE	36411	No, thanks, I'm good, now that I've remembered why it is that I'm willing to follow LeChuck anywhere.	Quartermaster.yack	148
IRONROSE	36412	Even when I think he's doing something stupid.	Quartermaster.yack	149
GUYBRUSH	36413	{point_hold}Just so we're clear... that means you're going to vote to go to Monkey Island now?	Quartermaster.yack	150
IRONROSE	36414	Yes. Even though I know you want me to.	Quartermaster.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	36415	Works for me!	Quartermaster.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	36416	As quartermaster, can't you just decide that we're going to Monkey Island and tell the others what to do?	Quartermaster.yack	159
IRONROSE	36417	Sorry, swabbie, that just isn't how it works. I respect the will of the crew. Everybody has to be in.	Quartermaster.yack	161
GUYBRUSH	36418	Your word carries a lot of weight around here. I think if you said we should go to Monkey Island, the others would get in line.	Quartermaster.yack	163
IRONROSE	36419	If I told you to knock it off and do your job, would you “get in line”?	Quartermaster.yack	165
GUYBRUSH	36420	Theoretically.	Quartermaster.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	36421	So, everything's more or less ready to go?	Quartermaster.yack	172
IRONROSE	36422	As soon as Madison's ship gets underway, we'll follow it.	Quartermaster.yack	174
GUYBRUSH	36423	I myself wasn't quite ready yet, because I still needed to steal LeChuck's map.	Quartermaster.yack	179
BOYBRUSH	36424	Oh yeah!	Quartermaster.yack	181
BOYBRUSH	36425	Why wasn't Madison's ship going yet?	Quartermaster.yack	183
GUYBRUSH	36426	They still needed a flattened skull to finish their potion, and it was up to me to get it over to them.	Quartermaster.yack	185
GUYBRUSH	36427	Have you seen Putra's application for promotion?	Quartermaster.yack	197
IRONROSE	36428	Of course. But that's something LeChuck has to approve personally.	Quartermaster.yack	200
IRONROSE	36429	Which he would never consciously do.	Quartermaster.yack	201
GUYBRUSH	36430	Want to guess which lowly swabbie got LeChuck to sign off on a promotion for Putra?	Quartermaster.yack	206
IRONROSE	36431	[overlap]Wow!	Quartermaster.yack	209		UPDATE
IRONROSE	36432	I don't know how you talked him into that, but my hat's off to you.	Quartermaster.yack	210
IRONROSE	36433	I'll see to the details. Why don't you show the order to Putra? She'll be pleased.	Quartermaster.yack	211
GUYBRUSH	36434	I'll do that.	Quartermaster.yack	212
GUYBRUSH	37349	{point}The clipboard in your hand says you're the quartermaster.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	45
IRONROSE	37350	The crew says I'm the quartermaster. Clipboard doesn't get a vote.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	47
IRONROSE	37351	You look like a guy without many options, you want a job? I'm short a swabbie.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	53
IRONROSE	37352	LeChuck's an equal opportunity employer, even humans are mostly tolerated.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	37353	Absolutely, I'd love to be a swabbie!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	55
GUYBRUSH	37354	{happy}Swabbing is one of my favorite things in the whole world.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	56
GUYBRUSH	37355	The restful mindless repetition, the delicate scent of old soapy water, the proud satisfaction of a sparkling plank...	QuartermasterHiring.yack	57
IRONROSE	37356	Okay, okay. Save the strokes for the decks.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	37357	{thinking}Have you got anything more senior?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	37358	No thanks, I'm getting my own expedition together.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	62
IRONROSE	37359	Suit yourself. I'm here if you change your mind.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	63
IRONROSE	37360	But don't dawdle, we sail with the tide.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	64
IRONROSE	37361	Back again?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	71
IRONROSE	37362	Yes?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	73
GUYBRUSH	37363	I want to ask about that swabbie job after all.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	37364	I'd like to discuss an officer position of some sort.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	76
GUYBRUSH	37365	Do you have any other job openings?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	37366	Just passing by.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	78
IRONROSE	37367	Try to stay out of the way.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	79
GUYBRUSH	37368	How do you like my mop? It's custom built!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	85
IRONROSE	37369	You know, you're in luck. I happen to be looking for a swabbie.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	87
IRONROSE	37370	The only requirement is that you bring your own mop.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	93
IRONROSE	37371	If you've got a mop, the job is- hey! Hey, wait a minute.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	94		UPDATE
IRONROSE	37372	(suspicious)What's your name, sailor?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	95
GUYBRUSH	37373	{fists_on_hips}Guybrush Threepwood.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	99
IRONROSE	37374	Yeah, that's what I thought.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	37375	{fists_on_hips}Smith. John Smith.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	102
IRONROSE	37376	Uh-huh.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	37377	{fists_on_hips}Andrew LeChuck. Nephew.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	104
IRONROSE	37378	Ballsy play, 'Andrew.'	QuartermasterHiring.yack	105
GUYBRUSH	37379	{fists_on_hips}Andrew LeChuck. No relation.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	106
IRONROSE	37380	What a coincidence.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	107
IRONROSE	37381	LeChuck gave me a blacklist, and you're on it.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	116
IRONROSE	37382	In fact you ARE the blacklist.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	122
IRONROSE	37383	I'm afraid I can't hire you after all.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	125
IRONROSE	37384	I'm sorry. Can't hire you. You're obviously Guybrush Threepwood.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	127		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37385	Well. That's a slight hitch.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	147
BOYBRUSH	37386	{confused}I'm confused. Didn't you say you were going to get your own ship?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	37387	{nodding}Yes. But then suddenly I thought, why bother?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	154
GUYBRUSH	37388	I wanted a ship and a crew, here was a ship and a crew. Ripe for the taking!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	156
GUYBRUSH	37389	All I had to do was get on board, wait for the right moment, and STRIKE!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	158
BOYBRUSH	37390	Strike?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	160
GUYBRUSH	37391	Mutiny the crew, seize the ship.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	162
GUYBRUSH	39351	{emphatic}Be a pirate!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	164
BOYBRUSH	37392	Except they wouldn't hire you because they knew who you were.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	37393	Yeah, that was a problem. Also, I needed a mop.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	168
IRONROSE	37394	Well...	QuartermasterHiring.yack	176		DELETE
IRONROSE	37395	Well, I need a Second Mate, a Boatswain, a Ship's Surgeon, and a Gunner.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	178		UPDATE
IRONROSE	37396	Do you think you're qualified for any of those?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	179
GUYBRUSH	37397	I could be Second Mate.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	182
GUYBRUSH	37398	I'd make a great Boatswain.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	183
GUYBRUSH	37399	How about Ship's Surgeon?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	184
GUYBRUSH	37400	I could be the Gunner!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	185
GUYBRUSH	37401	Maybe swabbie's not so bad after all.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	186
GUYBRUSH	37402	Okay, never mind.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	187
IRONROSE	37403	Do you honestly have any idea what a second mate does?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	191
GUYBRUSH	37404	{question}Goes to store openings and funerals and waits for the first mate to be incapacitated?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	192
IRONROSE	37405	I thought so.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	193
IRONROSE	37406	Exactly what qualifications have you got for that?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	197
GUYBRUSH	37407	I can hold my breath for ten minutes!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	198
GUYBRUSH	37408	Okay maybe eight.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	204
IRONROSE	37409	Don't waste my time, okay?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	205
IRONROSE	37410	I assume you have some kind of medical degree?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	209
GUYBRUSH	37411	{confused}Is that a definite requirement?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	210
IRONROSE	37412	Sorry.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	211
GUYBRUSH	37413	{brag}Oh, I'd be great at that! Boom, boom!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	215
IRONROSE	37414	You look a little scrawny. What do you bench?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	216
GUYBRUSH	37415	Bench? No problem, I sat on one for twelve hours once, I can take it.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	217
IRONROSE	37416	I have a lot to do today.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	218
GUYBRUSH	37417	Hey.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	224
IRONROSE	37418	Threepwood. I shouldn't even be talking to you.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	227
IRONROSE	37419	What is it?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	229
GUYBRUSH	37420	I'm not Guybrush Threepwood, I just look like him.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	232
GUYBRUSH	37421	You'd be amazed how often people confuse us.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	233
GUYBRUSH	37422	Sometimes I impersonate him at parties, just for fun.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	234
GUYBRUSH	37423	We've never even met, and I doubt I'd like him if we did.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	235
IRONROSE	37424	Even if any of that were true, it wouldn't matter.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	236
IRONROSE	37425	LeChuck would take one look at you and go nuts.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	237
IRONROSE	37426	Just looking like Guybrush Threepwood is enough that I can't give you the job.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	238
IRONROSE	37427	Sorry.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	239
GUYBRUSH	37428	Can I be on your ship if I change my name?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	241
IRONROSE	37429	Only if you also change your face.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	242
IRONROSE	37430	Sorry.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	243
GUYBRUSH	37431	C'mon, let me have the swabbie job.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	245
IRONROSE	37432	If you were anybody else, and you had a mop, I'd hire you.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	246
IRONROSE	37433	But you're you, so I'm sorry, I can't.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	247
GUYBRUSH	37434	Are you sure I can't convince you that I'm not Guybrush Threepwood?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	249
IRONROSE	37435	Just looking like Guybrush Threepwood is enough that I can't give you the job.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	250
IRONROSE	37436	Sorry.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	251
GUYBRUSH	37437	Never mind.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	253
GUYBRUSH	37438	What do you think of this baby? Signature model. I made it myself.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	258
IRONROSE	37439	I'm sure it's great, Threepwood, but I can't give you the swabbie job unless you magically turn into somebody else.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	260
IRONROSE	37440	Threepwood, are you trying to fool me by wearing an eyepatch? That is the worst disguise I've ever seen.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	275
GUYBRUSH	37441	No, no, of course not. Just having a little eye trouble. Blepharospasm.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	276
IRONROSE	37442	Oh, try some cashews, you might be short on magnesium. Or wits.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	277		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37443	Darn, I thought this thing was supposed to be magic. I must have forgotten something.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	290
GUYBRUSH	37444	Hi there. You must be the quartermaster.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	298
IRONROSE	37445	Yep.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	300
IRONROSE	37446	You look like a guy without many options. I need a swabbie.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	302
IRONROSE	37447	It's BYOM, so, show me a decent mop and the job's yours.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	303
GUYBRUSH	37448	Okay.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	304
IRONROSE	37449	I don't have time for chitchat, I'm trying to get this ship provisioned and out to sea.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	308
IRONROSE	37450	But show me a mop and you can come along.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	309
GUYBRUSH	37451	How do you like my mop? It's custom built!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	330
GUYBRUSH	37452	How's this for a mop?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	331
IRONROSE	37453	Let's see, stick, shoddy stuffed animal...	QuartermasterHiring.yack	333
IRONROSE	37454	Oh... I think that might be someone I used to know.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	334		UPDATE
IRONROSE	37455	Let's see, stick, tangle of boat line, smells like seagull droppings...	QuartermasterHiring.yack	335
IRONROSE	37456	Let's see, stick, blobby spongey part...	QuartermasterHiring.yack	336
IRONROSE	37457	Ehh. Good enough.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	338		UPDATE
IRONROSE	37458	Wait a minute, I've seen this mop before! Where did you get it?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	343
GUYBRUSH	37459	I made it myself!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	344
IRONROSE	37460	(suspicious)Hm. If you say so.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	345
IRONROSE	37461	I'm keeping my eye on you.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	346
GUYBRUSH	37462	Does that mean...	QuartermasterHiring.yack	347
GUYBRUSH	37463	All mops look like this nowadays, it's the style.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	348
IRONROSE	37464	Well, you're the expert, I guess.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	349
GUYBRUSH	37465	I stole it from a pirate.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	350
IRONROSE	37466	Oh, LeChuck will like that!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	351
GUYBRUSH	37467	No comment.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	352
IRONROSE	37468	Spoken like a true pirate.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	353
IRONROSE	37469	I happen to need a swabbie. You interested?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	357
GUYBRUSH	37470	Definitely.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	358
IRONROSE	37471	You're hired!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	360
GUYBRUSH	37472	Great!	QuartermasterHiring.yack	361
IRONROSE	37473	We'll be getting underway soon, why don't you come on board and I'll introduce you to the crew.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	362
GUYBRUSH	37474	I'm excited to see my stateroom. When's a good time to discuss the benefits package?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	379
GUYBRUSH	37475	What do you think of this mop?	QuartermasterHiring.yack	395
IRONROSE	37476	I think it's a stick.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	397
IRONROSE	37477	Mops usually have a floppy part at the end. You know, for mopping.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	398
GUYBRUSH	37478	Good point.	QuartermasterHiring.yack	401
GUYBRUSH	34820	Odina.	Queen.yack	27
QUEEN	34821	Actually, let's be formal after all, shall we?	Queen.yack	28
GUYBRUSH	34822	Your majesty.	Queen.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	34823	Your queenliness...	Queen.yack	31
GUYBRUSH	34824	Oh, most regal high authoritative benevolent ruler person...	Queen.yack	32
QUEEN	34825	Yes?	Queen.yack	33
GUYBRUSH	34826	Your majesty...	Queen.yack	37
GUYBRUSH	34827	Your queenliness...	Queen.yack	39
GUYBRUSH	34828	Oh, most regal high authoritative benevolent ruler person...	Queen.yack	41
QUEEN	34829	Ha! No need to be so formal, this is Brrr Muda!	Queen.yack	45
QUEEN	34830	You're Guybrush Threepwood, aren't you? I'm Odina IX. I know your wife.	Queen.yack	46
GUYBRUSH	34831	Elaine?	Queen.yack	48
QUEEN	34832	You sound uncertain. How many wives have you got?	Queen.yack	49
GUYBRUSH	34833	Just the one that I'm aware of.	Queen.yack	50
GUYBRUSH	34834	From when she was governor of Mêlée?	Queen.yack	51
QUEEN	34835	That was before I won my throne, but she does keep her hand in.	Queen.yack	52
GUYBRUSH	34836	And both feet.	Queen.yack	53
GUYBRUSH	34837	You do look familiar.	Queen.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	34838	Maybe I saw you in a cutscene or something.	Queen.yack	55
QUEEN	34839	I've been to your house, but I wouldn't expect you to remember it.	Queen.yack	56
QUEEN	34840	You were busy drawing a lot of lines on an old map.	Queen.yack	57
GUYBRUSH	34841	Yeah, that does sound like me.	Queen.yack	58
QUEEN	34842	The scurvy project seems to be coming along. Are you working on that as well?	Queen.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	34843	I helped a little.	Queen.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	34844	With a pamphlet.	Queen.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	34845	I came up with “Saber Fruit.”	Queen.yack	66
GUYBRUSH	34846	I came up with “Death Globes.”	Queen.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	34847	I came up with “Fang Berries.”	Queen.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	34848	Even though they didn't use my “Sublimes” idea.	Queen.yack	69
QUEEN	34849	Ha! Very nice.	Queen.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	34850	She's got it covered.	Queen.yack	71
QUEEN	34851	I'm sure she does!	Queen.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	34852	I've got dreams of my own.	Queen.yack	73
QUEEN	34853	I see.	Queen.yack	74
QUEEN	34854	What brings you north of the 19th parallel, Guybrush?	Queen.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	34855	Your crown, as a matter of fact.	Queen.yack	79
QUEEN	34856	Ha! Get in line. Everybody wants the crown!	Queen.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	34857	Everybody?	Queen.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	34858	Is that one of the Golden Keys on your head?	Queen.yack	83
QUEEN	34859	{indicate_crown}Welded to my crown. That's correct.	Queen.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	34860	I need your help to recover The Secret of Monkey Island.	Queen.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	34861	There are these five Golden Keys...	Queen.yack	87
QUEEN	34862	{indicate_crown}I'm vaguely aware of them. You can obviously see the one on my crown.	Queen.yack	88
QUEEN	34863	{indicate_crown}The Crown of Keys is a ceremonial artifact, worn by the reigning queen of Brrr Muda.	Queen.yack	92
QUEEN	34864	It was originally fashioned from the house keys of the citizens, as a gesture of trust.	Queen.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	34865	And/or submission?	Queen.yack	94
QUEEN	34866	My predecessor as queen is the one who added the Golden Key. I think it gives a certain pizzazz.	Queen.yack	95		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	34867	Naturally, you'll want to have that cleaned once in a while.	Queen.yack	97
QUEEN	34868	It stays perfectly clean as long as I don't let greasy pirates put their paws all over it.	Queen.yack	98
GUYBRUSH	34869	Perhaps I would be able to help safeguard that valuable item.	Queen.yack	99
QUEEN	34870	I think it's perfectly safe with me, and with the armed guards standing at the foot of the stairs, blocking your exit.	Queen.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	34871	Can I borrow it?	Queen.yack	101
QUEEN	34872	Nice try.	Queen.yack	102
QUEEN	34873	{indicate_crown}You may touch the crown if and when you become queen, and not before.	Queen.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	34874	Become queen. Interesting...	Queen.yack	105
GUYBRUSH	34875	Hypothetically, how exactly would a person become queen of Brrr Muda?	Queen.yack	111
GUYBRUSH	34876	Can you give me more details on the contests to become queen?	Queen.yack	113
GUYBRUSH	34877	I challenge you to the Contest of Heartiness!	Queen.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	34878	I challenge you to the Contest of Intelligence!	Queen.yack	115
GUYBRUSH	34879	I challenge you to the Contest of Seriousness!	Queen.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	34880	Thank you for the audience. I'll take my leave.	Queen.yack	118
QUEEN	34881	Very well, you may go.	Queen.yack	119
QUEEN	34882	You have to earn it! Win it! Wrest it from the iron grip of the previous queen!	Queen.yack	132
QUEEN	34883	Most people can't manage that, of course, but by the traditions of Brrr Muda, all are welcome to try.	Queen.yack	133
QUEEN	34884	To become queen, you must show your qualifications by defeating the current queen in three contests.	Queen.yack	134
QUEEN	34885	The contests test your heartiness, your seriousness, and your intelligence.	Queen.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	34886	I have some of those things.	Queen.yack	137
QUEEN	34887	We'll see.	Queen.yack	138
QUEEN	34888	And no cheating!	Queen.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	34889	We'll see.	Queen.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	34890	Three trials! It's just like becoming a pirate!	Queen.yack	141
QUEEN	34891	It's nothing like becoming a pirate!	Queen.yack	142
GUYBRUSH	34892	Except for the three trials part.	Queen.yack	143
QUEEN	34893	Contests. They're contests.	Queen.yack	144
GUYBRUSH	34894	What if I only want to be queen for a little while?	Queen.yack	145
GUYBRUSH	34895	Five minutes might be enough.	Queen.yack	146
QUEEN	34896	The queenship implies a lifelong commitment to uphold and defend your people.	Queen.yack	147
GUYBRUSH	34897	Okay, whatever. I get the crown, though?	Queen.yack	148
QUEEN	34898	Yes.	Queen.yack	149
GUYBRUSH	34899	Can I select a champion to compete for me?	Queen.yack	150
QUEEN	34900	Assuming you don't mind that your champion becomes queen, and you yourself are still not allowed to touch the crown.	Queen.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	34901	That second part sounds like a deal-breaker.	Queen.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	34902	Does this sort of thing happen a lot?	Queen.yack	153
QUEEN	34903	Constantly. Responding to challenges is one of my main duties as queen.	Queen.yack	154
QUEEN	34904	The Contest of Heartiness is an eating contest! Raw fish. Call it sushi if it helps you sleep better.	Queen.yack	159
QUEEN	34905	The Contest of Seriousness is one where you must keep a straight face. Whoever laughs first loses. Which I never do.	Queen.yack	160
QUEEN	34906	The Contest of Intelligence is an algebra test. Twenty second time limit, best answer wins. And yes I do always have the best answer.	Queen.yack	161

GUYBRUSH	39803	Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be a mighty pirate!	Scrapbook.dinky	20
GUYBRUSH	39804	That's me! Guybrush Threepwood.	Scrapbook.dinky	21
GUYBRUSH	39805	In the old days, you became a pirate by completing three trials, to prove your worth.	Scrapbook.dinky	24
TEXT	20648	June 18, 2020	Scrapbook.dinky	24
GUYBRUSH	39806	The pirate leaders were in charge of the Three Trials, acting as judge, jury, executioner, and devoted grog tasters.	Scrapbook.dinky	25

GUYBRUSH	39807	Treasure hunting is important for any pirate.	Scrapbook.dinky	26
TEXT	20650	Development won't start for another month or so, but we've been thinking about this for a while.	Scrapbook.dinky	26
GUYBRUSH	39808	Mastering swordfighting was more a matter of wits than agility.	Scrapbook.dinky	27
TEXT	20651	⬅︎⬅︎	Scrapbook.dinky	27
GUYBRUSH	39809	The test of thievery involved breaking into the governor’s mansion. The security was heavy!	Scrapbook.dinky	28
TEXT	20652	It seems like a good time to jot down a few thoughts, and then stash them away as a sort of time-capsule message to our future selves, about what we're setting out to do with Return to Monkey Island. 	Scrapbook.dinky	28
GUYBRUSH	39810	This is when I met Elaine, the love of my life. She was governor at the time.	Scrapbook.dinky	29		UPDATE

GUYBRUSH	39811	Things took an unexpected turn while I was working on the Three Trials.	Scrapbook.dinky	32
TEXT	20656	Monkey Island has historically been a reflection of the lives of the people who made the games. The Secret of Monkey Island was about a young person setting out to pursue an exciting new career. As designers in our twenties, that is what we all were.	Scrapbook.dinky	32
GUYBRUSH	39812	Elaine was kidnapped and taken to Monkey Island by the nefarious ghost pirate LeChuck!	Scrapbook.dinky	33
TEXT	20657	⬅︎⬅︎	Scrapbook.dinky	33
GUYBRUSH	39813	LeChuck thought he was in love with Elaine.	Scrapbook.dinky	34
TEXT	20658	The sequel, LeChuck's Revenge, was in many ways about the difficulties of making a sequel, or at least about what one does immediately after something that felt like a great success but which went unnoticed by most of the world at large. Many years (twenty!) later, after Guybrush had gone on a couple of adventures with other teams who had their own hopes and challenges, we set out to make Tales of Monkey Island as a story about trust, and it is, but what jumps out most for us is that it feels like a story about grown-ups.	Scrapbook.dinky	34
GUYBRUSH	39814	I scraped together a crew. Carla, Otis, and Meathook joined me on my voyage to Monkey Island to save Elaine.	Scrapbook.dinky	35
TEXT	20659	⬅︎⬅︎	Scrapbook.dinky	35
GUYBRUSH	39815	My first ship was the Sea Monkey! I bought it at Stan's Used Ships, with a letter of credit that I... sort of falsified.	Scrapbook.dinky	36
TEXT	20660	Because that's what we were, many of us in our forties by then, with children and lives and a lumpy encrusted layer of experience.	Scrapbook.dinky	36
TEXT	20661	⬅︎⬅︎	Scrapbook.dinky	37
TEXT	20662	We are well into our fifties now. We've had lengthy careers, we've made a lot of games. But Monkey Island still defines us to a certain degree, or, at least, in the minds of many we are Those Guys Who Made That Game A Long Time Ago. And it feels like there's some unfinished business there. When the opportunity arose to come back to Monkey Island, we were pretty much on the same page as to what we wanted to do.	Scrapbook.dinky	38
GUYBRUSH	39816	Monkey Island was a steaming, volcanic mystery, covered with jungle and not found on any map.	Scrapbook.dinky	39
TEXT	20663	⬅︎⬅︎	Scrapbook.dinky	39
GUYBRUSH	39817	You had to brew a special potion just to find Monkey Island. I made some substitutions, but it got us there just the same.	Scrapbook.dinky	40
TEXT	20664	Guybrush, like us, is older now, and he's had a long and reasonably successful career. But he is mostly associated with something that happened a long time ago, and that feels unfinished to him. The game is a goofy pirate adventure, the same as always, but also it's a story about trying to recapture the past, with all its alleged youthful strength and glory. Guybrush will both succeed and fail at this. He will sort of get what he wants, but it won't be what he expected.	Scrapbook.dinky	40
GUYBRUSH	39818	There were some people living there who claimed to be cannibals, but I think it was just a show for the tourists.	Scrapbook.dinky	41
TEXT	20665	⬅︎⬅︎	Scrapbook.dinky	41
GUYBRUSH	39819	On the island was a gigantic monkey head statue, with hidden catacombs underneath!	Scrapbook.dinky	42
TEXT	20666	I predict the same for us.	Scrapbook.dinky	42
GUYBRUSH	39820	The monkey head opened with a special key that you stuck in its ear!	Scrapbook.dinky	43
TEXT	20667	⬅︎⬅︎⬅︎⬅︎	Scrapbook.dinky	43
GUYBRUSH	39821	I met an old castaway there, Herman Toothrot. He and the locals wrote a lot of indignant letters to each other.	Scrapbook.dinky	44
TEXT	20668	:sig1: :sig2:	Scrapbook.dinky	44
GUYBRUSH	39822	LeChuck's ghostly ship was anchored in a lake of lava, hidden beneath the island's surface!	Scrapbook.dinky	45
GUYBRUSH	39823	We wound up back on Mêlée Island for the stunning conclusion to my first big adventure!	Scrapbook.dinky	48
GUYBRUSH	39824	I made it to the church just in time to stop the wedding! Or so I thought.	Scrapbook.dinky	49
GUYBRUSH	39825	It turned out Elaine already had everything under control. How does she do that?	Scrapbook.dinky	50
GUYBRUSH	39826	By then I had learned that ghosts like LeChuck are vulnerable to root beer! Just trust me, it works, okay?	Scrapbook.dinky	51
GUYBRUSH	39827	I defeated LeChuck, and he basically exploded!	Scrapbook.dinky	52
GUYBRUSH	39828	It was the beginning of something magical.	Scrapbook.dinky	53
GUYBRUSH	39829	These are from the time I went to find the treasure of Big Whoop!	Scrapbook.dinky	56
GUYBRUSH	39830	The map to the treasure had been torn into four pieces, which, let's face it, is about as piratey as it gets!	Scrapbook.dinky	57
GUYBRUSH	39831	I met my good friend Wally, who makes maps, and I stole his monocle. Good times.	Scrapbook.dinky	58
GUYBRUSH	39832	The mysterious Voodoo Lady at the International House of Mojo taught me to make a voodoo doll, which came in handy more than once!	Scrapbook.dinky	59
GUYBRUSH	39833	Elaine always seems to know when I need her!	Scrapbook.dinky	60
GUYBRUSH	39834	Again it came down to just me and LeChuck at the end. He was using magic, but then, so was I.	Scrapbook.dinky	61
GUYBRUSH	39835	One time, Elaine got turned into a statue. LeChuck was behind it of course. That guy never gives up.	Scrapbook.dinky	64
GUYBRUSH	39836	The fact that he turned her into a statue tells me LeChuck doesn't really love Elaine. He thinks of her as furniture.	Scrapbook.dinky	65
GUYBRUSH	39837	I got eaten by a snake!	Scrapbook.dinky	66
GUYBRUSH	39838	I got buried alive!	Scrapbook.dinky	67
GUYBRUSH	39839	I erupted a volcano on purpose! There's not a lot I wouldn't do for Elaine.	Scrapbook.dinky	68
GUYBRUSH	39840	It was around this time that I met Murray, the Allegedly All-Powerful Demonic Skull, after a rousing sea battle.	Scrapbook.dinky	69
GUYBRUSH	39841	Things backfired on LeChuck, because Elaine and I got married when it was all over. Game, set, matchmaker.	Scrapbook.dinky	70
GUYBRUSH	40430	I'm too busy to look at that right now.	Scrapbook.dinky	70
GUYBRUSH	39842	This was a great day, though in retrospect we shouldn't have had the Scumm Bar handle the catering.	Scrapbook.dinky	73
GUYBRUSH	39843	Elaine and me, together forever! The daggers are symbolic of cutting through troubles. I think.	Scrapbook.dinky	74
GUYBRUSH	39844	This is the daisy we stomped on together. Wedding traditions are weird!	Scrapbook.dinky	75
GUYBRUSH	39845	That's either Elaine's wedding veil or my handkerchief - we got them to match!	Scrapbook.dinky	76
GUYBRUSH	39846	I wrote a great haiku for the wedding invitation.	Scrapbook.dinky	77
GUYBRUSH	39847	I don't know why you have to have candy-coated almonds at a wedding. But apparently you do.	Scrapbook.dinky	78
GUYBRUSH	39848	Oh man, this was that crazy time LeChuck teamed up with an Australian billionaire, and tried to use a mystical talisman to make Elaine his bride!	Scrapbook.dinky	81
GUYBRUSH	39849	Everything started because they thought Elaine was dead so they held an election to replace her.	Scrapbook.dinky	82
GUYBRUSH	39850	The Ultimate Insult wasn't really ultimate, or even an insult at all... or was it?	Scrapbook.dinky	83
GUYBRUSH	39851	LeChuck and I battled it out on a grand scale that time.	Scrapbook.dinky	84
GUYBRUSH	39852	I made a goofy monster out of prosthetic body parts. It didn't help with anything, but I had fun doing it.	Scrapbook.dinky	85
GUYBRUSH	39853	Then there was the time I accidentally let loose LeChuck's pox over the entire Caribbean. Or so it seemed...	Scrapbook.dinky	88
GUYBRUSH	39854	I had to wear a hook for a while. It came in handy!	Scrapbook.dinky	89
GUYBRUSH	39855	Elaine wasn't fooled by LeChuck's human form any more than I was. I should have trusted her more!	Scrapbook.dinky	90
GUYBRUSH	39856	Morgan LeFlay betrayed me, even after we bonded inside a giant manatee! I should have trusted her less.	Scrapbook.dinky	91
GUYBRUSH	39857	I went on trial for my life on four separate charges! I defended myself, of course.	Scrapbook.dinky	92
GUYBRUSH	39858	Love did win out in the end.	Scrapbook.dinky	93
GUYBRUSH	39859	Oh, here's that voodoo doll from the end of my Big Whoop adventure!	Scrapbook.dinky	96
GUYBRUSH	39860	I defeated LeChuck with this. His leg came off as easy as tearing a loaf of bread...	Scrapbook.dinky	97
GUYBRUSH	40735	The death card doesn't usually represent literal physical death. Except when it does.	Scrapbook.dinky	127
HOVER	10367	Tell me more	Scrapbook.dinky	129
GUYBRUSH	40736	These are from the time I found The Secret of Monkey Island!	Scrapbook.dinky	140
GUYBRUSH	40737	I started my voyage at the Scumm Bar, but right away I could tell it wasn’t going to be like old times.	Scrapbook.dinky	141
GUYBRUSH	40738	The new pirate leaders were focused on sacking and pillaging. But plunder stats aren’t everything.	Scrapbook.dinky	142
GUYBRUSH	40739	I made the unusual decision to join LeChuck’s crew as a way to get to Monkey Island.	Scrapbook.dinky	143
GUYBRUSH	40740	In some quarters, my reputation was a disadvantage.	Scrapbook.dinky	144
GUYBRUSH	40741	I learned more than I ever wanted to know about mops.	Scrapbook.dinky	145		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	40742	Serving on LeChuck’s ship was an interesting experience.	Scrapbook.dinky	148
GUYBRUSH	40743	I grew to like the crew. I forgot all about looking like a zombie and starting a mutiny and seizing the ship.	Scrapbook.dinky	149
GUYBRUSH	40744	Gullet was my supervisor. Not a very pleasant guy.	Scrapbook.dinky	150
GUYBRUSH	40745	Putra was really happy when I got her promoted to chef!	Scrapbook.dinky	151
GUYBRUSH	40746	My disguise held up great, right up until we were nearing Monkey Island, when it, uh, well there was a failure.	Scrapbook.dinky	152
GUYBRUSH	40747	I got thrown off the ship. But that was okay, I’d gotten as far as I needed to.	Scrapbook.dinky	153
GUYBRUSH	40748	The actual return to Monkey Island was not what I expected.	Scrapbook.dinky	156
GUYBRUSH	40749	We all thought The Secret would be on the island somewhere.	Scrapbook.dinky	157
GUYBRUSH	40750	Everybody had a map. Some more useful than others.	Scrapbook.dinky	158
GUYBRUSH	40751	I learned some deeply personal things about my nemesis, LeChuck.	Scrapbook.dinky	159
GUYBRUSH	40752	The temporary pact I made with my enemies turned out to be about five minutes more temporary than I had hoped.	Scrapbook.dinky	160
GUYBRUSH	40753	Elaine and I rebuilt my old ship, the Sea Monkey, so we could sail back to Mêlée!	Scrapbook.dinky	161
GUYBRUSH	40754	It was a race to get to The Secret first!	Scrapbook.dinky	164
GUYBRUSH	40755	I hunted down all five Golden Keys. I wonder if I was supposed to keep these?	Scrapbook.dinky	165
GUYBRUSH	40756	LeChuck teamed up with Madison, but that was never going to last.	Scrapbook.dinky	166
GUYBRUSH	40757	Madison was scheming to betray LeChuck.	Scrapbook.dinky	167
GUYBRUSH	40758	Lila was scheming to betray Madison AND LeChuck.	Scrapbook.dinky	168
GUYBRUSH	40759	I’m not sure Trent ever thought very far ahead.	Scrapbook.dinky	169
GUYBRUSH	40760	Widey Bones told me all about the Golden Keys.	Scrapbook.dinky	170
GUYBRUSH	40761	Elaine had a lot on her plate, but she was with me in the end.	Scrapbook.dinky	171
GUYBRUSH	40762	Carla handled earthquake relief as best she could under the circumstances.	Scrapbook.dinky	172
GUYBRUSH	40763	I broke Stan out of prison.	Scrapbook.dinky	173
GUYBRUSH	40764	Wally was kidnapped.	Scrapbook.dinky	174
GUYBRUSH	40765	The Voodoo Lady disappeared.	Scrapbook.dinky	175
GUYBRUSH	40766	I unseated the reigning queen to become the last queen of Brrr Muda!	Scrapbook.dinky	176
GUYBRUSH	40767	I visited Herman Toothrot in his cozy hermit cave.	Scrapbook.dinky	177
GUYBRUSH	40768	I managed to recover The Secret, but then LeChuck stole it and took it back to Monkey Island to open it!	Scrapbook.dinky	178
GUYBRUSH	40769	We chased LeChuck back to Monkey Island again, and I tracked him down!	Scrapbook.dinky	181
GUYBRUSH	40770	Elaine held off Flair Gorey while I went into the monkey!	Scrapbook.dinky	182
GUYBRUSH	40771	I found Wally!	Scrapbook.dinky	183
GUYBRUSH	40772	Someone had devised a series of themed pirate-monkey puzzles to keep out the unworthy.	Scrapbook.dinky	184
GUYBRUSH	40773	I made this mockup of the final puzzle. I think it’s pretty neat!	Scrapbook.dinky	185
GUYBRUSH	40774	Oh shoot! I wonder when this fell out?	Scrapbook.dinky	186
GUYBRUSH	40828	Wait, what's this?	Scrapbook.dinky	190

GUYBRUSH	36662	Hi! Any chance I could get inside the quarry?	Scroo.yack	27
GUARD	36663	Not many try to get in here. Just out. What's the purpose of your visit?	Scroo.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	36664	I was hoping for a tour.	Scroo.yack	30
GUARD	36665	We don't give tours here.	Scroo.yack	31
GUYBRUSH	36666	It's a social call.	Scroo.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	36667	I'm an ice retailer, investigating supply possibilities.	Scroo.yack	33
GUARD	36668	You'd have to take that up with the head office, which is not inside the quarry.	Scroo.yack	34
GUYBRUSH	36669	I'd like to break one of the prisoners out.	Scroo.yack	35
GUARD	36670	Oh, we have rules about that.	Scroo.yack	36
GUARD	36671	Escapes are not allowed. You could forfeit visitation rights with your friend or family member.	Scroo.yack	37
GUYBRUSH	36672	Visitation rights!	Scroo.yack	38

GUARD	36675	{excuse_me}It's not your quarry, your majesty. It's a federal facility, overseen by the 673rd Circuit Court.	Scroo.yack	43
GUARD	36676	The only people allowed inside are the prisoners.	Scroo.yack	46
GUARD	36677	And also, I suppose, people visiting the prisoners, but no one ever does that.	Scroo.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	36678	I'd like to visit a prisoner, please.	Scroo.yack	51

GUARD	36704	Sorry, nobody here by that name. Beat it.	Scroo.yack	85
GUARD	36705	We do have a Stan. I'm a little surprised he'd have a visitor.	Scroo.yack	92
GUARD	36706	Can you prove you know him?	Scroo.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	36707	I can describe him. Loud jacket. Never stops moving his arms. Or his lips.	Scroo.yack	94
GUARD	36708	That does sound like him, but I'm supposed to see some actual physical evidence.	Scroo.yack	95
GUARD	36709	Just bring me something that shows you two have ever been in a room together.	Scroo.yack	96
GUARD	36710	That way I can tell my fa- uh, my boss, that I did my job.	Scroo.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	36711	I'd like to visit my close friend Stan, please.	Scroo.yack	99
GUARD	36712	Like I told you, I need to see some hard evidence that you've ever been within two feet of each other.	Scroo.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	36713	What do you think of this picture of me and my extremely dear friend Stan together?	Scroo.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	36714	We had it painted at our local muskrat club meeting.	Scroo.yack	108
GUARD	36715	You look real close.	Scroo.yack	110
GUARD	36716	All right, you can go in and see him.	Scroo.yack	111
GUARD	36717	He's a prisoner here, did you come to see him?	Scroo.yack	112
GUYBRUSH	36718	Yes please.	Scroo.yack	113
GUARD	36719	Okay.	Scroo.yack	114

GUYBRUSH	36721	{handsup}I wouldn't dream of it.	Scroo.yack	116

GUYBRUSH	36724	I'm back to see Stan again.	Scroo.yack	129

GUYBRUSH	36730	Is the lockdown over yet?	Scroo.yack	193
GUARD	36731	Nope.	Scroo.yack	194
GUYBRUSH	36732	Can I get back inside? I want to admire the sculptures, maybe take home a few souvenirs.	Scroo.yack	198
GUARD	36733	Nope. We're on lockdown.	Scroo.yack	200
GUYBRUSH	36734	Okay.	Scroo.yack	201
GUYBRUSH	36735	Why?	Scroo.yack	202
GUARD	36736	Well, don't tell anyone, but there was an e-s-c-a-p-e.	Scroo.yack	204
GUARD	36737	All the prisoners are gone.	Scroo.yack	205

GUYBRUSH	40313	If I tried to move that I'd throw my back out.	SecretAltar.dinky	539
GUYBRUSH	40314	One of the stone slabs from the altar seems to have fallen off during the rumbling.	SecretAltar.dinky	550
GUYBRUSH	39595b	(Caught in trap) Aahhhh!!!	SecretAltar.dinky	563
GUYBRUSH	40458	Hey! This is just Styrofoam!	SecretAltar.dinky	805
HOVER	12348	Massive boulder!	SecretAltar.dinky	848

HOVER	12352	I'm not touching that!	SecretAltar.dinky	898
HOVER	12353	Read the inscription	SecretAltar.dinky	916
GUYBRUSH	40725	I can't make it out. I think it's written in Sanskrit or something.	SecretAltar.dinky	940
HOVER	12429	Captain Madison's hat	SecretAltar.dinky	940
GUYBRUSH	40726	“Employees must wash hands.”	SecretAltar.dinky	942
GUYBRUSH	40891	So long, Captain Madison.	SecretAltar.dinky	943
GUYBRUSH	40892	This is like one of those mystery stories where the person has so many enemies the detectives don't know where to start.	SecretAltar.dinky	947
GUYBRUSH	30935	I'm too busy to look at that right now.	SheetMusic.dinky	27
GUYBRUSH	31755	Uh, hello? Anyone up there, patrolling the deck, ready to kick me into the sea?	ShipSide.dinky	12
GUYBRUSH	31756	Sounds like the coast is clear. I hope.	ShipSide.dinky	15
GUYBRUSH	31757	Unless it's a trap.	ShipSide.dinky	15

GUYBRUSH	31760	It's the ship's hold. Home sweet home?	ShipSide.dinky	372
GUYBRUSH	31761	So many fond greasy memories.	ShipSide.dinky	376
HOVER	10923	Open the porthole	ShipSide.dinky	380
GUYBRUSH	31762	They've sealed it shut!	ShipSide.dinky	385
HOVER	12286	Could I open the porthole with this?	ShipSide.dinky	389
HOVER	10924	Pretty small anchor for a ship this size	ShipSide.dinky	392
GUYBRUSH	40175	I can already tell I'm not going to be able to do that.	ShipSide.dinky	392

GUYBRUSH	31768	I think that's LeChuck's cabin, but it wasn't on the introductory tour.	ShipSide.dinky	437
GUYBRUSH	31769	Tempting, but the climb would be beyond even my legendary skills.	ShipSide.dinky	440
GUYBRUSH	31770	Fortunately there's a much more straightforward way to get in there.	ShipSide.dinky	442

HOVER	10639	This must've been Bella Fisher's ship	Shipwreck.dinky	198
HOVER	10640	This must be Bella Fisher's ship	Shipwreck.dinky	198
GUYBRUSH	31416	Ooh, it's beautiful!	Shipwreck.dinky	201		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	31417	It's still more or less in one piece.	Shipwreck.dinky	203
GUYBRUSH	31418	It's not my fault! They shouldn't have stuck the key in there so hard.	Shipwreck.dinky	205
HOVER	10641	That must be Bella Fisher	Shipwreck.dinky	213
GUYBRUSH	31419	Looks like I've tracked you down. Really far down, actually.	Shipwreck.dinky	215
HOVER	10642	Bella Fisher looks angry	Shipwreck.dinky	222
HOVER	10643	Bella Fisher still looks angry	Shipwreck.dinky	222
GUYBRUSH	31420	I'm not superstitious, but I've seen one too many angry ghosts. I'd better split.	Shipwreck.dinky	225
GUYBRUSH	31421	I'm not sure my story did much good.	Shipwreck.dinky	227
GUYBRUSH	32261	What happened to Stan's Previously Owned Vessels!	Shipyard.dinky	59
GUYBRUSH	38750	Wow, it's worse than I imagined!	Shipyard.dinky	61
GUYBRUSH	32262	Stan's building collapsed! This place looks like an earthquake hit it.	Shipyard.dinky	64

HOVER	11248	Squeeze the sponge	Shipyard.dinky	92
HOVER	11249	Strange mass	Shipyard.dinky	92
GUYBRUSH	32263	It's bone dry. I guess Stan hasn't washed a ship in a while.	Shipyard.dinky	96
GUYBRUSH	32264	It's a dried up old sea sponge.	Shipyard.dinky	98
HOVER	11250	Take the sponge	Shipyard.dinky	102
HOVER	11251	Assess the picture	Shipyard.dinky	114
HOVER	11252	A picture?	Shipyard.dinky	114
GUYBRUSH	32265	It's a good likeness of Stan, but someone's torn off whoever was next to him.	Shipyard.dinky	117
GUYBRUSH	32266	There's a torn picture in here. This half shows Stan himself.	Shipyard.dinky	119
HOVER	11253	Take the picture	Shipyard.dinky	123
HOVER	11256	Place Stan's picture near the frame	Shipyard.dinky	128
HOVER	11257	It's Stan's old toothbrush	Shipyard.dinky	141
HOVER	11258	A toothbrush?	Shipyard.dinky	141
GUYBRUSH	32271	This must be that old toothbrush Stan wanted.	Shipyard.dinky	143
GUYBRUSH	32272	It's an old wooden toothbrush.	Shipyard.dinky	143
HOVER	11259	Take the toothbrush	Shipyard.dinky	146
HOVER	11260	Read the note again	Shipyard.dinky	154
HOVER	11261	What's this note?	Shipyard.dinky	154
GUYBRUSH	32273	“The assets of this establishment have been seized to settle a class action lawsuit. Have a nice day.”	Shipyard.dinky	156
HOVER	11262	Peer through the window	Shipyard.dinky	162
GUYBRUSH	32274	The window's all boarded up, and it's very dark in there.	Shipyard.dinky	164
GUYBRUSH	32275	Is that an old toothbrush?	Shipyard.dinky	164
HOVER	11263	Pry off the boards	Shipyard.dinky	167
GUYBRUSH	40803	I don't want to wreck my brand new shiny knife.	Shipyard.dinky	173
HOVER	11264	Read the sign	Shipyard.dinky	178
GUYBRUSH	32278	It says, “TAN'S Previously Owned Vessels.”	Shipyard.dinky	180
GUYBRUSH	32279	So sad, Stan's used to be the best place to buy used ships.	Shipyard.dinky	180
HOVER	11265	Gaze at the moon	Shipyard.dinky	187
GUYBRUSH	32280	It always looks bigger on this side of the island.	Shipyard.dinky	190
HOVER	11266	Gaze at the moon	Shipyard.dinky	193
GUYBRUSH	32281	It always looks bigger on this side of the island.	Shipyard.dinky	196
HOVER	11267	Ponder the mooring bollard	Shipyard.dinky	202
GUYBRUSH	32283	There was a time when every mooring would be filled with one of Stan's used ships.	Shipyard.dinky	204
GUYBRUSH	38751	Looks like the only available ship on the island right now is LeChuck's.	Shipyard.dinky	204
HOVER	11268	Ponder the mooring bollard	Shipyard.dinky	210
HOVER	11269	Remember happier times	Shipyard.dinky	220
GUYBRUSH	32284	I remember when these torches lit up Stan's Previously Owned Vessels like a carnival.	Shipyard.dinky	222
GUYBRUSH	32285	This used to be such a bright, cheery place.	Shipyard.dinky	223
GUYBRUSH	32286	It's sad to see the shipyard like this.	Shipyard.dinky	224
GUYBRUSH	32287	I remember the first time Stan tried to fleece me.	Shipyard.dinky	225
GUYBRUSH	32288	If a ship was shot full of holes, Stan would stick oars in them and call it a galley.	Shipyard.dinky	226
HOVER	11270	Remember happier times	Shipyard.dinky	233
HOVER	11271	Remember happier times	Shipyard.dinky	241

HOVER	11275	Rust bucket	Shipyard.dinky	273
HOVER	11276	Bucket?	Shipyard.dinky	273
GUYBRUSH	32289	Stan used this to clean his ships. It's all rusted out now.	Shipyard.dinky	275

LECHUCK	30297	{yelling}(yelling)There's been a lot of whining lately, about “promotions” and “compensation” and “respect.”	Shouting.dinky	68

GULLET	39763	(Senses LeChuck behind him)Oooop?	SoupSpill.dinky	282
GULLET	39764	(Senses LeChuck behind him)Oooop?	SoupSpill.dinky	283
GULLET	39765	(Senses LeChuck behind him)Gulp!	SoupSpill.dinky	289
GULLET	39766	(Senses LeChuck behind him)Gulp!	SoupSpill.dinky	290
GULLET	39767	(Senses LeChuck behind him)Gulp!	SoupSpill.dinky	291
LECHUCK	30540	Start making the potion again!	SoupSpill.dinky	296
LECHUCK	30541	I'll be in me cabin, gritting me collection of other people's teeth.	SoupSpill.dinky	300
FLAIRGOREY	30542	Redo the potion, is that even possible?	SoupSpill.dinky	314
IRONROSE	30543	No.	SoupSpill.dinky	317
IRONROSE	30544	We barely scraped together the ingredients the first time, we're out of almost everything.	SoupSpill.dinky	319
PUTRA	30545	Who wants to tell LeChuck?	SoupSpill.dinky	324
IRONROSE	30546	No one should tell LeChuck, let's not be stupid.	SoupSpill.dinky	326
FLAIRGOREY	30547	Let's tip the cauldron back and pretend we're working on it. Maybe he'll forget about it eventually.	SoupSpill.dinky	329
IRONROSE	30548	You don't know LeChuck like I do. But it'll buy us some time.	SoupSpill.dinky	334
BOYBRUSH	30549	Is this one of those times where you substitute different stuff for all the ingredients and it works anyway?	SoupSpill.dinky	344
GUYBRUSH	30550	No. They were right, we couldn't make the potion again.	SoupSpill.dinky	346
BOYBRUSH	30551	But you told me that you can't get to Monkey Island unless you make the potion.	SoupSpill.dinky	348
GUYBRUSH	30552	I did. But, as it turns out, there IS a way. We storytellers call what's happening now a “twist.”	SoupSpill.dinky	350
BOYBRUSH	30553	Okay, so what did you do? Was there a magic map? An ancient sea creature? Did you move the island instead of the ship?	SoupSpill.dinky	353
GUYBRUSH	30554	Whoa there! Do you want to tell the story, or listen to me?	SoupSpill.dinky	355
BOYBRUSH	30555	Do I have to answer that?	SoupSpill.dinky	357
GUYBRUSH	30556	There was an important piece of the puzzle that I hadn't seen yet. I started by looking around the ship for opportunities...	SoupSpill.dinky	360
MURRAY	38568	Hey!	SoupSpill.dinky	397
CAPTAINTRENT	33670	That's not LeChuck!	SpringTrap.yack	11
GUYBRUSH	33671	You must be the smart one.	SpringTrap.yack	22
GUYBRUSH	33672	LeChuck is a greenish, shouty guy with a beard and a big hat.	SpringTrap.yack	23
GUYBRUSH	33673	Oh, the trap is for LeChuck! That explains the root beer.	SpringTrap.yack	24
GUYBRUSH	33674	Why would you want a LeChuck when you could have a Guybrush?	SpringTrap.yack	25
GUYBRUSH	33675	I'm a little confused about who you're double-crossing. Is it everybody?	SpringTrap.yack	26
CAPTAINTRENT	33676	This clown won't know LeChuck's secrets, but I guess we could torture him anyway?	SpringTrap.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	33677	Wait!	SpringTrap.yack	34
GUYBRUSH	33678	What was that you said about LeChuck's secrets?	SpringTrap.yack	39
GUYBRUSH	33679	I know plenty of LeChuck's secrets.	SpringTrap.yack	40
GUYBRUSH	33680	Maybe I can help. No torture necessary.	SpringTrap.yack	41
CAPTAINLILA	33681	Do you know LeChuck's theme song, his catchphrase, or his favorite food?	SpringTrap.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	33682	Not exactly.	SpringTrap.yack	46
CAPTAINLILA	33683	Exactly is important.	SpringTrap.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	33684	How about his lookout's favorite food? I know that one.	SpringTrap.yack	49
GUYBRUSH	33685	All too well.	SpringTrap.yack	50
GUYBRUSH	33686	How about the first two notes of his theme song?	SpringTrap.yack	52
CAPTAINLILA	33687	Not enough.	SpringTrap.yack	53
GUYBRUSH	33688	Why on earth would you care about any of that?	SpringTrap.yack	55
CAPTAINLILA	33689	Not helpful.	SpringTrap.yack	59
CAPTAINMADISON	33690	This is going nowhere.	SpringTrap.yack	62
CAPTAINLILA	33691	(accusatory) We wouldn't even be in this bind if you'd let me kill him on Mêlée.	SpringTrap.yack	63
CAPTAINMADISON	33692	Don't start with me, Lila!	SpringTrap.yack	64
CAPTAINMADISON	33693	{hold_map}Remember it was me that intercepted the real map on its way to LeChuck in the first place!	SpringTrap.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	33694	That's a blank piece of paper.	SpringTrap.yack	66
CAPTAINMADISON	33695	It's encrypted!	SpringTrap.yack	67
CAPTAINLILA	33696	I can reveal it with a Dark Magic spell, but I have to have LeChuck's personal information to break the security.	SpringTrap.yack	72
CAPTAINLILA	33697	As part of the spell we have to play his music, say his catchphrase, and eat his favorite food.	SpringTrap.yack	73
GUYBRUSH	33698	You could just ask him?	SpringTrap.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	33699	He's here on the island.	SpringTrap.yack	76
CAPTAINMADISON	33700	LeChuck is too powerful to face directly. This trap was supposed to catch him off guard so we could get the information out of him.	SpringTrap.yack	78
CAPTAINLILA	33701	And now we're out of root beer.	SpringTrap.yack	79
GUYBRUSH	33702	I swallowed a lot, maybe wait a half hour?	SpringTrap.yack	82
CAPTAINLILA	33703	Or, I poke a hole in you and it squirts out right away.	SpringTrap.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	33704	We could search his ship for information while he's gone?	SpringTrap.yack	85
CAPTAINMADISON	33705	We thought of that, but the ship's enchanted to be unboardable.	SpringTrap.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	33706	We could ask his crew about all that stuff?	SpringTrap.yack	87
CAPTAINMADISON	33707	We thought of that, but they're on the ship, and it's enchanted to be unboardable.	SpringTrap.yack	88
CAPTAINLILA	33708	Only LeChuck and his crew can get on it.	SpringTrap.yack	91
GUYBRUSH	33709	I'm not sure I was ever technically fired...	SpringTrap.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	33710	I mean, I did wind up at the bottom of the ocean, but no one ever said the words, “you're fired.”	SpringTrap.yack	96
CAPTAINMADISON	33711	You can get on the ship?	SpringTrap.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	33712	Probably.	SpringTrap.yack	98
GUYBRUSH	33713	I mean definitely. Yes.	SpringTrap.yack	99
CAPTAINMADISON	33714	Fine.	SpringTrap.yack	100
CAPTAINMADISON	33715	Here's the deal. You find out what we need to know, we decode the map, and we split The Secret four ways.	SpringTrap.yack	101
CAPTAINMADISON	33716	That's the only offer, and I won't make it again. In or out.	SpringTrap.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	33717	What are the alternatives?	SpringTrap.yack	105
CAPTAINLILA	33718	We kill you.	SpringTrap.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	33719	I accept.	SpringTrap.yack	108
BOYBRUSH	33720	No way! You teamed up with Captain Madison?	SpringTrap.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	33721	They were planning to double-cross me, of course.	SpringTrap.yack	118
GUYBRUSH	33722	My only option was to do it first.	SpringTrap.yack	120
GUYBRUSH	33723	Double-cross them before they could double-cross me. Triple-cross!	SpringTrap.yack	122
BOYBRUSH	33724	Dad.	SpringTrap.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	33725	I'd get them what they needed to work the spell on the map, and then I'd find a way to steal it.	SpringTrap.yack	126
BOYBRUSH	33726	Cool!	SpringTrap.yack	128
CAPTAINLILA	33727	Remember, it's his theme music, catchphrase, and favorite food.	SpringTrap.yack	144
GUYBRUSH	40117	Oof!!	SpringTrap.yack	144
CAPTAINMADISON	33728	(pickup for clarity)We're camped at the big monkey head if you need anything.	SpringTrap.yack	145		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33729	{point_up}Actually, there is one thing...	SpringTrap.yack	156
TEXT	20015	Meanwhile, at the Scumm Bar...	Spy.dinky	7
CAPTAINLILA	30410	Threepwood's on LeChuck's ship. He's got some kind of disguise.	Spy.dinky	28
CAPTAINLILA	30411	From the bargain bin it looks like.	Spy.dinky	30
CAPTAINMADISON	30412	So what?	Spy.dinky	32
CAPTAINTRENT	30413	You don't think this could be a problem? We didn't plan for him.	Spy.dinky	35
CAPTAINLILA	30414	I hate not knowing what's going on. I should have taken him out the minute he walked in here.	Spy.dinky	37
CAPTAINMADISON	30415	Don't worry, we'll know what's going on.	Spy.dinky	41
CAPTAINLILA	30416	Yeah? How?	Spy.dinky	44
CAPTAINMADISON	30417	I've got a spy on board the ship.	Spy.dinky	48
BOYBRUSH	30418	So, once you were on LeChuck's ship, you turned the tables on them!	Spy.dinky	107
BOYBRUSH	30419	You whipped out your sword and said, “I'm your captain now, take me to Monkey Island or you'll all walk the plank!”	Spy.dinky	110
GUYBRUSH	30420	More or less...	Spy.dinky	113
GUYBRUSH	33730	Hey, Stan.	Stan.yack	30
STAN	33731	Hello there, son.	Stan.yack	31
GUYBRUSH	33732	Sorry to see you in jail.	Stan.yack	35
STAN	33733	Thank you son, I appreciate the thought. I'm sorry to see me here as well.	Stan.yack	36
GUYBRUSH	33734	I was really hoping to buy a ship from you.	Stan.yack	38
STAN	33735	Well now normally, I would do absolutely anything to get you into a comfortable ride right away.	Stan.yack	40
STAN	33736	But my hands are tied, they're shackled, I can't do it, not at any price!	Stan.yack	41
STAN	33737	I'm completely out of inventory! Every ship on the lot was seized! By unscrupulous lawyers who don't care about your sailing needs the way I do.	Stan.yack	42
GUYBRUSH	33738	That's terrible!	Stan.yack	43
STAN	33739	Believe me, I feel worse about it than you do.	Stan.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	33740	Okay, don't worry about it. I've already got a plan to steal a ship from LeChuck.	Stan.yack	46
STAN	33741	Well, If you don't get killed, look me up afterwards. I'll give you a good price for anything that can stay above the waterline.	Stan.yack	47		UPDATE
STAN	33742	Naturally, it'll have to be store credit until I get back on my feet.	Stan.yack	48
GUYBRUSH	33743	Are you sure there's no way I can get a ship from you?	Stan.yack	50
STAN	33744	I'm afraid that's the case.	Stan.yack	52
GUYBRUSH	38947	{thinking}Nuts. It's starting to look like LeChuck's ship really is the only available ship on the island.	Stan.yack	53
GUYBRUSH	33746	What did you do that got you arrested?	Stan.yack	55
STAN	33747	Let me tell you something, son. It's not what a man does that matters. It's who he is!	Stan.yack	56
STAN	33748	Maybe one day in a moment of weakness he crosses a line, but if he's confident about what's in his heart he can hold his head high!	Stan.yack	57
STAN	33749	And you know what's in my heart, son?	Stan.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	33750	{confused}Blood and goopy stuff?	Stan.yack	59
STAN	33751	People! People are in my heart!	Stan.yack	60
STAN	33752	Anything I may have allegedly done, you can be sure I did it because I care about people!	Stan.yack	61
GUYBRUSH	33753	What exactly did you allegedly do for people, that got you arrested?	Stan.yack	63
STAN	33754	I gave them what they wanted!	Stan.yack	64
STAN	33755	Now naturally, people don't always know that they want the things they want.	Stan.yack	65		UPDATE
STAN	33756	Sometimes it takes a man with a talent like mine to show them the way!	Stan.yack	66
STAN	33757	And sometimes, people who are jealous of that sort of talent will try to put all sorts of unpleasant labels on it.	Stan.yack	67
STAN	33758	They use hurtful words like “scam” and “misrepresentation” and even “fraud.”	Stan.yack	68
STAN	33759	But it's all just marketing, son, as natural as the rocks and the trees and the Mêlée Island flounder birds, and that's why I'm not worried.	Stan.yack	69
STAN	33760	I'm awaiting final judgment of the court, but I'm certain I'll be acquitted. They don't hang people for marketing.	Stan.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	33761	It sounds like you should have been arrested several decades ago.	Stan.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	33762	I mean why now, all of a sudden?	Stan.yack	73
STAN	33763	One word: jurisdiction!	Stan.yack	74
STAN	33764	I was expanding my core business, you see, trying to provide ship owners with a variety of ship-maintenance necessities.	Stan.yack	75
STAN	33765	Sponges, barnacle scrapers, repair manuals, rudder tape - I had a whole line of products.	Stan.yack	76
STAN	33766	I expanded my distribution to other islands, all over the Caribbean. And that's when I ran into trouble!	Stan.yack	77
STAN	33767	Some of those islands have different laws, you see, that might not seem so fair to men like you and me.	Stan.yack	78
STAN	33768	They slapped me with a ton of paper, talking about things like “standards of quality” and “consumer protection” and “environmental impact.”	Stan.yack	79
STAN	33769	They didn't understand that I wasn't really selling porthole wipers, I was selling happiness!	Stan.yack	80
STAN	33770	And my customers were happy! They were perfectly happy right up until some clown with a briefcase came along and told them they weren't.	Stan.yack	81
STAN	33771	It's a crock, son, and that's why it won't stand up in court. I'll be out before you know it.	Stan.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	39653	Didn't you used to have a law practice or something?	Stan.yack	84
STAN	39654	Used to, but I was disbarred for what we former law practitioners call “moral turpitude.”	Stan.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	39655	Is that a real word?	Stan.yack	86
STAN	39656	More or less. It's one of those handy catch-all words that you can use whenever you want because it doesn't mean anything specific.	Stan.yack	87
GUYBRUSH	33772	Would it help if I broke you out of jail?	Stan.yack	89
STAN	33773	Now that's a kind offer, it truly is. Warms me to think that you'd do that for your old pal Stan.	Stan.yack	91		UPDATE
STAN	33774	But I've got to think about the optics. I don't want to damage my case, and escaping from jail doesn't look good at trial.	Stan.yack	92
STAN	33775	So thanks, but, no thanks.	Stan.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	33776	Are you sure you don't want me to break you out?	Stan.yack	95
STAN	33777	One hundred and fifteen percent, son, but thanks.	Stan.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	33778	Is there anything else I can do for you?	Stan.yack	98
STAN	33779	Now that you mention it, there is one thing I've been missing during my time here in this lofty establishment.	Stan.yack	100
STAN	33780	In all the rush and fuss and document shredding surrounding my arrest, I completely forgot to grab my toothbrush!	Stan.yack	101
STAN	33781	If you happen to be passing by the shipyard, you might grab it for me. It'll be on my desk in the office.	Stan.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	33782	Sure thing.	Stan.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	33783	I've been to the shipyard, your office is all boarded up.	Stan.yack	105
GUYBRUSH	33784	With your toothbrush sealed inside, presumably.	Stan.yack	106
STAN	33785	Well don't worry yourself about it then, son. I found a dead centipede in the corner that should do until they let me out.	Stan.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	33786	{proud}I'm going after The Secret of Monkey Island!	Stan.yack	109
STAN	33787	The Secret! Boy, that takes me back.	Stan.yack	112
STAN	38948	But if you're looking for help, you're barking up the wrong enchilada!	Stan.yack	113
STAN	33788	Just remember, life has no guarantees or warrantees. Only jamborees!	Stan.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	33789	Thanks, that's... advice.	Stan.yack	115
GUYBRUSH	33790	See you later.	Stan.yack	117
STAN	33791	Yep!	Stan.yack	118
GUYBRUSH	33792	Could I get a ship from you after you're out of jail?	Stan.yack	123
STAN	33793	Don't count on it, son. I expect to be released any time, but I haven't even got anything on backorder.	Stan.yack	124
STAN	33794	It pains me to lose a sale, but if you need to get off this island, you're going to have to find another way.	Stan.yack	125
GUYBRUSH	33795	Could you refer me to a competitor?	Stan.yack	127
STAN	33796	Stab me in the heart! You'd go to a competitor? Where's your loyalty, son?	Stan.yack	128
GUYBRUSH	33797	Well seeing as you're in jail and have no ships and can't help me, I thought...	Stan.yack	129
STAN	33798	It doesn't matter anyway. There's no competition! I drove 'em all out of business long ago. Nobody can play the angles like old Stan!	Stan.yack	130
STAN	33799	I didn't really anticipate a situation like this one coming up.	Stan.yack	131
GUYBRUSH	33800	Any tips on how to steal a ship from someone else?	Stan.yack	133
STAN	33801	One word, son: mutiny!	Stan.yack	134
STAN	33802	Get yourself on board a worthy vessel, gain the confidence of the crew, wait for the right moment, and strike!	Stan.yack	135
STAN	33803	If you don't get killed, look me up afterwards. I'll give you a good price for anything that can stay above the waterline.	Stan.yack	136
STAN	33804	Naturally, it'll have to be store credit until I get back on my feet.	Stan.yack	137
GUYBRUSH	33805	Okay, well, thanks, I guess.	Stan.yack	139
STAN	33806	Anything I can do to help, you let me know. As long as it doesn't involve selling you a ship.	Stan.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	33807	Hey, Stan.	Stan.yack	151
STAN	33808	Hi there, son! Nice to see you. What're you in for?	Stan.yack	162		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33809	Piracy.	Stan.yack	167
STAN	33810	You got a raw deal, son, everybody does that! It's barely even a crime.	Stan.yack	168
STAN	33811	But technically it is, and since you're here, I've got an idea to share with you.	Stan.yack	169
GUYBRUSH	33812	Pleurisy.	Stan.yack	170
STAN	33813	That medical debt's a killer, isn't it?	Stan.yack	171
STAN	33814	Maybe I can offer you a way to numb the pain.	Stan.yack	172
GUYBRUSH	33815	About five to ten.	Stan.yack	173
STAN	33816	Minutes or hours? You don't have the look of a man doing any more than that.	Stan.yack	174
STAN	33817	No, you have the look of a man who's going places, and who might want to decorate those places when he gets there.	Stan.yack	175
GUYBRUSH	33818	Some sort of a sales pitch, I expect.	Stan.yack	176
STAN	33819	Pitches are for baseball, son, I make introductions! I'm like a matchmaker between you and your future.	Stan.yack	177
GUYBRUSH	33820	Nothing, I came to see you.	Stan.yack	178
STAN	33821	Always a good idea, son. When you need something, come see Stan.	Stan.yack	179
STAN	33822	And you've picked a good time, because I have seen the future.	Stan.yack	180
STAN	33823	I want you to consider these two words:	Stan.yack	186
STAN	33824	[overlap]Ice.	Stan.yack	187
STAN	33825	[overlap]Sculpture.	Stan.yack	188
STAN	33826	[overlap]Separately, they're exciting.	Stan.yack	189
STAN	33827	[overlap]Strength. Elegance. Transparency.	Stan.yack	190
STAN	33828	[overlap]Together, they could be life-changing!	Stan.yack	191
STAN	33829	[overlap]The chill of the Arctic combined with the blaze of the avant-garde!	Stan.yack	192
STAN	33830	[overlap]Nature, tamed by man, bent to his will with chisels and fire!	Stan.yack	193
STAN	33831	[overlap]These fine examples of neo-post-colonial abstract representationalism can turn a dining room into a banquet hall!	Stan.yack	194
STAN	33832	[overlap]A shack into a palace!	Stan.yack	195
STAN	33833	[overlap]A simple celebration into an earth-shattering, once-in-a-lifetime EVENT!	Stan.yack	196
STAN	33834	[overlap]They're limited edition masterpieces, made with all-natural ingredients, and are one hundred percent biodegradable!	Stan.yack	197
STAN	33835	[overlap]And, they come with an expiration guarantee!	Stan.yack	198
STAN	33836	[overlap]They're engineered to transform continuously, taking on new shapes and offering new insights each day!	Stan.yack	199
STAN	33837	[overlap]Over time they become more compact, eventually suitable for inclusion in the celebratory cocktail you use to toast your next purchase.	Stan.yack	200
STAN	33838	[overlap]Sure fire! Can't miss! What do you say?	Stan.yack	201
GUYBRUSH	33839	[silent]I don't think so.	Stan.yack	207
GUYBRUSH	33840	[silent]Not today.	Stan.yack	209
GUYBRUSH	33841	[silent]No thanks.	Stan.yack	211
GUYBRUSH	33842	{handsup}[overlap]Stan!	Stan.yack	217
GUYBRUSH	33844	I don't think so.	Stan.yack	224
GUYBRUSH	33845	Not today.	Stan.yack	225
GUYBRUSH	33846	No thanks.	Stan.yack	226
STAN	33847	Don't wait too long, they're selling like hotcakes.	Stan.yack	228
STAN	33848	Howdy, son.	Stan.yack	230
GUYBRUSH	33849	Did you know there's an escape tunnel over there?	Stan.yack	235
STAN	33850	Why sure! Chisel Pete dug that a few days ago.	Stan.yack	238
STAN	33851	Don't think they even know he's gone yet.	Stan.yack	239
GUYBRUSH	33852	How about I bust you out of here?	Stan.yack	241
GUYBRUSH	33853	Tell me more about that pyramid scheme you mentioned.	Stan.yack	242
GUYBRUSH	33854	Are you sure you don't want me to break you out?	Stan.yack	243
STAN	33855	Like I said, I'll be out in a month anyway.	Stan.yack	244
STAN	33856	I can handle the shackles until then.	Stan.yack	245
GUYBRUSH	33857	What was the name of your accountant again?	Stan.yack	247
STAN	33858	Ned Filigree. He's good, and he works cheap.	Stan.yack	248
STAN	33859	Be careful, though, he's got a hang-up about meticulous record keeping that can be problematic if anyone looks too close.	Stan.yack	249
GUYBRUSH	33860	{proud}I'm on a hunt for The Secret of Monkey Island!	Stan.yack	251
GUYBRUSH	33861	My hunt for The Secret of Monkey Island is going great!	Stan.yack	252
GUYBRUSH	33862	{upset}This place sure is quiet.	Stan.yack	253
STAN	33863	That's what productivity sounds like!	Stan.yack	254
GUYBRUSH	33864	Remind me what you said about Elaine's lime-marketing problem?	Stan.yack	256
GUYBRUSH	33865	I think I'll poke around a little.	Stan.yack	257
STAN	33866	You enjoy yourself, son.	Stan.yack	258
GUYBRUSH	33867	Elaine and I could use some marketing advice.	Stan.yack	269
GUYBRUSH	33868	The Marley Foundation is trying to combat scurvy by distributing limes, but, no one is willing to take them.	Stan.yack	270
STAN	33869	I feel your pain, son.	Stan.yack	271
STAN	33870	I had a similar problem selling life preservers in the farming community.	Stan.yack	272
STAN	33871	Sometimes people don't know what they want even when they want it.	Stan.yack	273
STAN	33872	You got any promotional materials?	Stan.yack	274
GUYBRUSH	33873	Elaine made this pamphlet.	Stan.yack	275
STAN	33874	Hm. Mm-hm. I see the problem.	Stan.yack	290
STAN	33875	It's wrong from top to bottom! You couldn't sell water to fish with this blather!	Stan.yack	291
GUYBRUSH	33876	{small_shrug}(admitting)It's a little dry.	Stan.yack	292
STAN	33877	It's got facts in it! Worse than that, SCIENTIFIC facts!	Stan.yack	293
STAN	33878	I'll need to meet with her to iron this out.	Stan.yack	294
GUYBRUSH	33879	Can't you just tell me what to do and I'll tell her?	Stan.yack	295
STAN	33880	No, no. That won't do.	Stan.yack	296
STAN	33881	Things get lost in translation! A whinny isn't a whinny if it doesn't come out of a horse's mouth!	Stan.yack	297
STAN	33882	No shade on you, son, but you're not a pro, you wouldn't be able to convey the nuance that's needed here.	Stan.yack	298
STAN	33883	She and I have got to have a meeting of the minds, and minds have got to meet face-to-face.	Stan.yack	300
GUYBRUSH	33884	I'll let her know.	Stan.yack	301
GUYBRUSH	33885	This place seems a little harsher than the jail on Mêlée.	Stan.yack	305
GUYBRUSH	33886	I might or might not know a competent locksmith who could take care of those shackles.	Stan.yack	306
STAN	33887	Oh no son, I can't escape. Wouldn't be wise. I'm only in for a month, after all.	Stan.yack	330
STAN	33888	Got a copy of the judge's order right here!	Stan.yack	331
STAN	33889	Yeah, I sure did get off light. Lucky for me they never caught on to my pyramid scheme, or I'd probably be doing ten years!	Stan.yack	347
STAN	33890	Honestly I don't know why the law makes such a big deal about it, it's just creative money management. Easy if you know what to do with the figures.	Stan.yack	353
STAN	33891	I've got this accountant, Ned Filigree, he's a genius with that stuff. If they ever saw his records...	Stan.yack	354
STAN	33892	Well, let's just say the first thing I'm doing when I get out is go burn all that paperwork.	Stan.yack	355		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	33893	I have some disturbing news about your sentence.	Stan.yack	365
STAN	33894	Ten years?! Oh, no. I can do a month standing on my head, but not ten years!	Stan.yack	374
STAN	33895	You gotta get me out of here!	Stan.yack	375
GUYBRUSH	33896	Your shackle is already unlocked, we can go right now.	Stan.yack	378
STAN	33897	Good point!	Stan.yack	379
GUYBRUSH	33898	Consider it done.	Stan.yack	382
GUYBRUSH	33899	I know exactly where it is. I've just got to get my hands on five Golden Keys.	Stan.yack	389
GUYBRUSH	33900	As soon as I get them all, The Secret will be mine.	Stan.yack	390
GUYBRUSH	33901	{defiant}Mine!	Stan.yack	391
STAN	33902	Easy there, tiger. You don't want to start drooling in weather like this.	Stan.yack	392
STAN	33903	Might freeze solid while you're talking, and then where are you?	Stan.yack	393
STAN	33904	In a prison work camp with your tongue stuck to your face like a big pink boil, that's where.	Stan.yack	394
GUYBRUSH	33905	(no thanks)Thanks a lot for that image, Stan.	Stan.yack	395
GUYBRUSH	33906	Hey, Stan.	Stan.yack	402
STAN	33907	You gotta get me out of here, son! I can't do ten years!	Stan.yack	403		UPDATE
STAN	40533	Good for you, kid. Closing time comes too soon for us all, you've got to try all the snacks you can before it does.	Stan.yack	404
GUYBRUSH	33908	Know where Stan is?	Stan.yack	416
GUYBRUSH	33909	Seen Stan?	Stan.yack	416
GUYBRUSH	33910	Loud guy, big hat?	Stan.yack	416
GUYBRUSH	33911	You know Stan?	Stan.yack	416
GUYBRUSH	33918	Keep up the good work.	Stan.yack	432
GUYBRUSH	33919	Art school graduate, eh?	Stan.yack	432
GUYBRUSH	33920	You're doing a great job.	Stan.yack	432
GUYBRUSH	33921	Love what you're doing there.	Stan.yack	432
GUYBRUSH	33922	Very cool!	Stan.yack	432

GUYBRUSH	38050	Herman Toothrot?	Toothrot.yack	20
TOOTHROT	38051	I think so. It's been a while.	Toothrot.yack	21
TOOTHROT	38052	Names do funny things when you're not using them.	Toothrot.yack	22
GUYBRUSH	38053	How have you been?	Toothrot.yack	27
TOOTHROT	38054	Meh.	Toothrot.yack	28
GUYBRUSH	38055	Have you been in this cave very long?	Toothrot.yack	30
TOOTHROT	38056	Well, not in geologic terms.	Toothrot.yack	31
TOOTHROT	38057	As a percentage of the total number of years of existence of the cave itself, it would be a small number.	Toothrot.yack	32
TOOTHROT	38058	On a human scale, however...	Toothrot.yack	33
TOOTHROT	38059	...YEEEEESSSS!!	Toothrot.yack	34
TOOTHROT	38060	(completely back to normal)It all depends on your perspective.	Toothrot.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	38061	I'm looking for a Golden Key.	Toothrot.yack	37
TOOTHROT	38062	Sounds like something I might have read in a book once.	Toothrot.yack	38
TOOTHROT	38063	One of the characters in At the End of the Plank has a gold house key.	Toothrot.yack	39
TOOTHROT	38064	Are you a fictional character?	Toothrot.yack	40
GUYBRUSH	38065	Not that I'm aware of.	Toothrot.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	38066	How does a person get out of this place?	Toothrot.yack	43
TOOTHROT	38067	Typically, you don't.	Toothrot.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	39450	Are you freaked out by all the weird screaming in the caves?	Toothrot.yack	46
GUYBRUSH	38069	Can I get you anything?	Toothrot.yack	47
TOOTHROT	38070	Out would be nice.	Toothrot.yack	48
GUYBRUSH	38071	I think I'll have a look around.	Toothrot.yack	50
TOOTHROT	38072	I'll be here when you've finished the grand tour.	Toothrot.yack	51
GUYBRUSH	38073	I think I'll have a look around.	Toothrot.yack	53
TOOTHROT	38074	I don't think much has changed.	Toothrot.yack	54
TOOTHROT	38075	Oh, that's me! Just a little light entertainment and well-being work.	Toothrot.yack	58
TOOTHROT	38076	Primal screaming is very therapeutic. Try it!	Toothrot.yack	59
GUYBRUSH	38077	No thanks.	Toothrot.yack	60
TOOTHROT	38078	Suit yourself.	Toothrot.yack	61
GUYBRUSH	38079	(pathetically weak version of primal scream therapy scream)AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!	Toothrot.yack	63
GUYBRUSH	38080	Phew. You're right, that feels good.	Toothrot.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	38081	What did this used to be?	Toothrot.yack	70
TOOTHROT	38082	That's the cover of a book I was reading. “At the End of the Plank.”	Toothrot.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	38083	Tell me more about At the End of the Plank.	Toothrot.yack	78
TOOTHROT	38084	It's a solid if somewhat predictable story, about a roguish pirate and a doomed romance with a woman of station.	Toothrot.yack	83
TOOTHROT	38085	I ate the pages long ago, but before my lamp ran out I memorized quite a bit of it.	Toothrot.yack	84
TOOTHROT	38086	Want to hear a quote?	Toothrot.yack	85
GUYBRUSH	38087	Sure.	Toothrot.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	38088	Some other time.	Toothrot.yack	87
TOOTHROT	38089	If I'm available. Maybe I've got plans.	Toothrot.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	38090	Stirring.	Toothrot.yack	95
TOOTHROT	38091	No touching!	Toothrot.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	38092	That's a Golden Key!	Toothrot.yack	126
TOOTHROT	38093	Maybe. It's mine.	Toothrot.yack	127
GUYBRUSH	38094	You were hunting for the keys too!	Toothrot.yack	129
GUYBRUSH	38095	That's how you got stuck here!	Toothrot.yack	130
TOOTHROT	38096	Is it? I suppose that would make sense.	Toothrot.yack	131
GUYBRUSH	38097	Let's make a deal for the key.	Toothrot.yack	133
TOOTHROT	38098	I'm pretty sure I wanted it for a reason, but, a decade or so in a dark cave can do funny things to your memory.	Toothrot.yack	135
TOOTHROT	38099	So, get me out of here, and then I'll let you have the key.	Toothrot.yack	136
GUYBRUSH	38100	How do I know I can trust you?	Toothrot.yack	145
TOOTHROT	38101	I don't know. How do I know I can trust you?	Toothrot.yack	147
GUYBRUSH	38102	I don't know, how do I know I can trust you?	Toothrot.yack	149
TOOTHROT	38103	I don't know. How do I know I can trust you?	Toothrot.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	38104	If you let me have the key, then I'll get you out of the cave.	Toothrot.yack	153
TOOTHROT	38105	That sounds good, as long as it's escape first, key afterward.	Toothrot.yack	155
GUYBRUSH	38106	It needs to be key first, then escape.	Toothrot.yack	157
TOOTHROT	38107	It needs to be escape first, then key.	Toothrot.yack	159
GUYBRUSH	38108	Me having the key is for the greater good.	Toothrot.yack	161
TOOTHROT	38109	For the greater good of you, certainly.	Toothrot.yack	163
GUYBRUSH	38110	Just give me the key already!	Toothrot.yack	165
TOOTHROT	38111	No!	Toothrot.yack	167
GUYBRUSH	38112	[silent]Give! Me! That! Key!	Toothrot.yack	169
GUYBRUSH	38113	Any ideas?	Toothrot.yack	180
TOOTHROT	38114	I was hoping you'd have one.	Toothrot.yack	182
TOOTHROT	38115	Singalong?	Toothrot.yack	182
TOOTHROT	38116	Truth or dare?	Toothrot.yack	182
TOOTHROT	38117	I'm thinking maybe I did imagine you after all.	Toothrot.yack	182
TOOTHROT	38118	I don't suppose you've got a handy way out of here in your pocket?	Toothrot.yack	182
GUYBRUSH	38119	I'm sorry.	Toothrot.yack	184
TOOTHROT	38120	Can I have my key back?	Toothrot.yack	185

GUYBRUSH	31703	Hey Bob, would you like to read this book? It's about a voyage that never ends.	TopDeck.dinky	992
YARDARM	31704	Sounds interesting! And long!	TopDeck.dinky	995
YARDARM	31705	Here's your joke book back.	TopDeck.dinky	1001
GUYBRUSH	31706	Hey Bob, I've got a great book for you.	TopDeck.dinky	1014
GUYBRUSH	31707	It has some excellent recipes.	TopDeck.dinky	1024
YARDARM	31708	Are you trying to torture me? I haven't eaten for centuries.	TopDeck.dinky	1027
GUYBRUSH	31709	It's “The Big Book of Treasure Maps.”	TopDeck.dinky	1030
YARDARM	31710	I've had enough treasure hunting for this month, thanks.	TopDeck.dinky	1033
GUYBRUSH	31711	It's “Ship-to-Ship Combat Strategies.”	TopDeck.dinky	1036
YARDARM	31712	I stopped studying combat strategy when I made the shift to yardarm hanging.	TopDeck.dinky	1039
GUYBRUSH	31713	It's “Voodoo Tricks You Can Do at Home.”	TopDeck.dinky	1042
YARDARM	31714	I'm no good with tricks, and my home was destroyed in a tsunami 75 years ago. Thanks all the same.	TopDeck.dinky	1045
GUYBRUSH	31715	It's “The Autobiography of Jon Laney.”	TopDeck.dinky	1048
YARDARM	31716	No, I heard he used a ghost writer for that. Pass.	TopDeck.dinky	1051
GUYBRUSH	39495	It seems relatable. It's “At the End of the Plank.”	TopDeck.dinky	1055
YARDARM	39496	I read that with my book club.	TopDeck.dinky	1058
YARDARM	39497	It's a mediocre story about a roguish pirate and a doomed romance with a woman of station.	TopDeck.dinky	1059
YARDARM	39498	The ending's no good.	TopDeck.dinky	1060
GUYBRUSH	31719	It's my poetry!	TopDeck.dinky	1064
YARDARM	31720	Er... thanks, I've got a book already.	TopDeck.dinky	1067
GUYBRUSH	31721	It's Gullet's poetry! Unpublished, you can get a sneak peek!	TopDeck.dinky	1069
YARDARM	31722	There is nothing about Gullet that I want a sneak peek of.	TopDeck.dinky	1072
GUYBRUSH	31723	It's LeChuck's personal diary.	TopDeck.dinky	1076
YARDARM	31724	Yikes, I wouldn't want to be caught with that! And you shouldn't either.	TopDeck.dinky	1079
GUYBRUSH	31725	What kinds of books DO you like?	TopDeck.dinky	1091
YARDARM	31726	At this point, I'd have to say “long ones.”	TopDeck.dinky	1094
YARDARM	31727	I go for pure, unadulterated, massive length.	TopDeck.dinky	1096
YARDARM	31728	The trouble with books is that they end.	TopDeck.dinky	1098
YARDARM	31729	Also what I really need is a book that will last me a long time.	TopDeck.dinky	1102

GUYBRUSH	33033	It's a sculpture of yours truly. My jawline has never looked so chiseled.	TownCenter.dinky	253
GUYBRUSH	33034	It's a remarkably accurate representation of Queen Odina IX of Brrr Muda.	TownCenter.dinky	255

HOVER	11765	Pick up the skull	VolcanoBeach.dinky	135
HOVER	11766	Conk the skull	VolcanoBeach.dinky	140
HOVER	11767	Return to LeChuck's needlessly overstated ship	VolcanoBeach.dinky	152
HOVER	11768	Into the jungle	VolcanoBeach.dinky	193
HOVER	11769	Just some driftwood	VolcanoBeach.dinky	202
GUYBRUSH	32869	It's some driftwood that washed up on the beach. I can relate.	VolcanoBeach.dinky	204
HOVER	12221	A very dead squid	VolcanoBeach.dinky	212
GUYBRUSH	38803	I'm not even a fan of live squid.	VolcanoBeach.dinky	214
HOVER	11637	Slice off a tentacle	VolcanoBeach.dinky	217
HOVER	11638	Slice off another tentacle	VolcanoBeach.dinky	217
GUYBRUSH	38804	I'd rather leave the rest for nature to clean up.	VolcanoBeach.dinky	231
GUYBRUSH	37179	Nice to see you again.	Voodoo.yack	29
VOODOOLADY	37180	I have been waiting for you.	Voodoo.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	37181	[silent] You mean ever since we last saw each other? It's been years!	Voodoo.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	37182	You mean-	Voodoo.yack	33
VOODOOLADY	37183	Fate ordained that you would be here several minutes ago.	Voodoo.yack	34
VOODOOLADY	37184	Only you can manage to be late even when you are fated to arrive.	Voodoo.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	37185	It's a gift.	Voodoo.yack	36
GUYBRUSH	37186	[silent] I'm going in search of The Secret of Monkey Island!	Voodoo.yack	37
GUYBRUSH	37187	I'm going-	Voodoo.yack	39
VOODOOLADY	37188	I know of your desire to find The Secret of Monkey Island.	Voodoo.yack	40
GUYBRUSH	37189	[silent] I don't suppose you have a bunch of cash handy and want to finance an expedition?	Voodoo.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	37190	I don't-	Voodoo.yack	42
VOODOOLADY	37191	I cannot give you what you wish, but perhaps I can help in another way.	Voodoo.yack	43
GUYBRUSH	37192	[silent] Do you know where I can find an available ship?	Voodoo.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	37193	Do you-	Voodoo.yack	45
VOODOOLADY	39348	The best place to look for a ship is at a dock.	Voodoo.yack	46
GUYBRUSH	37195	[silent] I'm planning to get on a ship with LeChuck. Any advice?	Voodoo.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	37196	I'm planning-	Voodoo.yack	48
VOODOOLADY	37197	To sail with LeChuck is most brash, Guybrush. But it is what you must do.	Voodoo.yack	49
VOODOOLADY	37198	Allow me to seek knowledge on your behalf?	Voodoo.yack	51
GUYBRUSH	37199	Will it cost me anything?	Voodoo.yack	52
VOODOOLADY	37200	Pride. Free will. Not much.	Voodoo.yack	63
VOODOOLADY	37201	The way to The Secret is like a serpent which swallows itself. Many obstacles lie ahead.	Voodoo.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	37202	Serpent. Obstacles. Got it.	Voodoo.yack	83
VOODOOLADY	37203	You must walk the path, yet you have already walked the path.	Voodoo.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	37204	And now I'm going back again.	Voodoo.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	39682	Small concerned gasp	Voodoo.yack	107
VOODOOLADY	37205	When you are unsure of the way forward, open this book for guidance on what is to come.	Voodoo.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	37206	It can tell me my future?	Voodoo.yack	120
VOODOOLADY	37207	In a way. Think of it as a book of hints.	Voodoo.yack	121
GUYBRUSH	37208	What is it really?	Voodoo.yack	122
VOODOOLADY	37209	A book of hints.	Voodoo.yack	123
VOODOOLADY	37210	Use it wisely. To know too much diminishes the voyage.	Voodoo.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	37211	Neat! Thanks!	Voodoo.yack	129
VOODOOLADY	37212	No charge.	Voodoo.yack	130
GUYBRUSH	37213	Your sign says you're going out of business.	Voodoo.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	37214	Or is this one of those “not really going out of business” going out of business sales?	Voodoo.yack	136
GUYBRUSH	37215	How does Dark Magic work?	Voodoo.yack	138
VOODOOLADY	37216	Runes.	Voodoo.yack	139
VOODOOLADY	37217	Chemicals.	Voodoo.yack	140
VOODOOLADY	37218	The power of secrets.	Voodoo.yack	141
VOODOOLADY	37219	I am no expert. It's too sterile for my tastes, I like things messy and theatrical.	Voodoo.yack	142
GUYBRUSH	37220	Is Dark Magic powerful?	Voodoo.yack	144
VOODOOLADY	37221	Powerful, yes, it can be. But dangerous.	Voodoo.yack	145
VOODOOLADY	37222	If the badger chews his own tail, soon there is no more badger.	Voodoo.yack	146
GUYBRUSH	37223	You like that metaphor a lot, don't you?	Voodoo.yack	147
VOODOOLADY	37224	It has many uses.	Voodoo.yack	148
GUYBRUSH	37225	Can Dark Magic get me to Monkey Island?	Voodoo.yack	150
VOODOOLADY	37226	No.	Voodoo.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	37227	Nuts.	Voodoo.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	37228	Where can I get my hands on some Dark Magic?	Voodoo.yack	154
VOODOOLADY	37229	Dark Magic is not your path, Guybrush Threepwood.	Voodoo.yack	155
GUYBRUSH	37230	Do you know more about this Jon Laney guy with the eyepatch?	Voodoo.yack	157
GUYBRUSH	37231	Tell me again about Laney and the eyepatch.	Voodoo.yack	158
GUYBRUSH	37232	Can you charge Jon Laney's eyepatch up for me?	Voodoo.yack	159
GUYBRUSH	37233	Can you charge Jon Laney's eyepatch up for me?	Voodoo.yack	160
GUYBRUSH	37234	Can you tell me where to find the Bite of a Thousand Needles?	Voodoo.yack	161
GUYBRUSH	37235	I don't suppose you sell mops?	Voodoo.yack	162
VOODOOLADY	37236	I cannot guide you on matters of mops. The true master is the cook at the Scumm Bar.	Voodoo.yack	163
GUYBRUSH	37237	Can you use your talents to tell me how Elaine is right now?	Voodoo.yack	165
VOODOOLADY	37238	She is always close, no matter the distance.	Voodoo.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	37239	{point}Do your answers ever make sense?	Voodoo.yack	167
VOODOOLADY	37240	There are no answers. Only questions that are finished.	Voodoo.yack	168
GUYBRUSH	37241	Are you able to see what LeChuck is up to?	Voodoo.yack	170
VOODOOLADY	37242	Your goals and the goals of LeChuck are aligned as always.	Voodoo.yack	171
VOODOOLADY	37243	But his intentions are darker. He would use The Secret to do terrible things.	Voodoo.yack	172
GUYBRUSH	37244	{defiant}“Dark-ER”? What's that supposed to mean?	Voodoo.yack	173
VOODOOLADY	37245	LeChuck must not acquire The Secret.	Voodoo.yack	174
GUYBRUSH	37246	No argument there.	Voodoo.yack	175
GUYBRUSH	37247	Is this the year when you finally tell me your name?	Voodoo.yack	177
GUYBRUSH	37250	It's become almost a running gag between us.	Voodoo.yack	179
GUYBRUSH	39349	But it's awkward, like when your glass is empty but you keep trying to drink out of it over and over.	Voodoo.yack	181
VOODOOLADY	37256	It is Corina.	Voodoo.yack	182
GUYBRUSH	37259	Oh. Okay. Corina. Nice.	Voodoo.yack	183
GUYBRUSH	37260	Somehow it was more exciting before I knew that.	Voodoo.yack	185
VOODOOLADY	37261	That is true of many things.	Voodoo.yack	186
GUYBRUSH	37262	Will I succeed?	Voodoo.yack	188
VOODOOLADY	37263	Achievement depends mostly on the definition of success.	Voodoo.yack	189
GUYBRUSH	37264	Got any other mystical advice or information for me?	Voodoo.yack	191
GUYBRUSH	37265	Stock tips or something?	Voodoo.yack	192
VOODOOLADY	37266	No.	Voodoo.yack	193
GUYBRUSH	37267	Never mind.	Voodoo.yack	196
VOODOOLADY	37268	I never do.	Voodoo.yack	197
GUYBRUSH	37269	I'll get back to browsing the shop.	Voodoo.yack	200
VOODOOLADY	37270	Act fast. Supplies are limited.	Voodoo.yack	201
VOODOOLADY	37271	There is a new Dark Magic on the rise in the Caribbean.	Voodoo.yack	209
VOODOOLADY	37272	It has many adherents, particularly among the young.	Voodoo.yack	210
VOODOOLADY	37273	There is little demand for my talents, or my wares. Business is terrible.	Voodoo.yack	211
VOODOOLADY	37274	And there are other factors. Captain Madison desires this location.	Voodoo.yack	212
VOODOOLADY	37275	That it belongs to me will be of little help against her financial and political powers.	Voodoo.yack	213
GUYBRUSH	37276	{point_up}Back up. Dark Magic, you said?	Voodoo.yack	214
VOODOOLADY	37277	I did.	Voodoo.yack	215
GUYBRUSH	37278	This is a neat symbol. What does it mean?	Voodoo.yack	221
VOODOOLADY	37279	That used to contain magical disguises. But alas, they have all gone.	Voodoo.yack	222
GUYBRUSH	39350	That's okay.	Voodoo.yack	223
GUYBRUSH	37280	It's too bad you're sold out. A magic disguise seems really useful.	Voodoo.yack	228
VOODOOLADY	37281	There is always the famous eyepatch of Jon Laney, at the museum.	Voodoo.yack	229
VOODOOLADY	37282	I'm sure the magic has worn off by now, but I believe I could restore its abilities.	Voodoo.yack	230
GUYBRUSH	37283	I got what I needed elsewhere.	Voodoo.yack	234
VOODOOLADY	37284	Captain Jon Laney was renowned as the pirate of a thousand faces.	Voodoo.yack	238
VOODOOLADY	37285	It was said that he could fool his best friend with nothing more than an eyepatch.	Voodoo.yack	239
VOODOOLADY	37286	That legend is true, but, only because the eyepatch he used was filled with much voodoo magic.	Voodoo.yack	240
VOODOOLADY	37287	The eyepatch still exists. It is on display at the Museum of Pirate Lore, here on Mêlée Island.	Voodoo.yack	241
VOODOOLADY	37288	If an enterprising person such as yourself were to... liberate it, and bring it here, I could most likely get it working again.	Voodoo.yack	242
GUYBRUSH	37289	Got it. Thanks.	Voodoo.yack	243
VOODOOLADY	37290	Ah! The famous eyepatch disguise of Jon Laney.	Voodoo.yack	275
VOODOOLADY	37291	As I suspected, the magic has long since drained away.	Voodoo.yack	287
GUYBRUSH	37292	Good. Great. So, can you charge it up again?	Voodoo.yack	288
VOODOOLADY	37293	I can. If...	Voodoo.yack	289
GUYBRUSH	37294	If?	Voodoo.yack	290
VOODOOLADY	37295	If you bring me one more thing. A particular charm of great power.	Voodoo.yack	291
GUYBRUSH	37296	You couldn't have told me this earlier?	Voodoo.yack	292
VOODOOLADY	37297	I could have.	Voodoo.yack	293
VOODOOLADY	37298	You must bring me the Bite of a Thousand Needles. Then, I will recharge your eyepatch.	Voodoo.yack	294
GUYBRUSH	37299	“The Bite of a Thousand Needles”? Can you be a tiny bit more specific?	Voodoo.yack	295
VOODOOLADY	37300	No.	Voodoo.yack	296
GUYBRUSH	37301	All right, I'll see what I can do.	Voodoo.yack	297
VOODOOLADY	37302	I wish I could.	Voodoo.yack	302
GUYBRUSH	37303	Me too.	Voodoo.yack	303
GUYBRUSH	37304	(angry)You've had it all this time!	Voodoo.yack	311
VOODOOLADY	37305	I possess little, and much. To what are you referring?	Voodoo.yack	312
GUYBRUSH	37306	(angry)Don't play dumb with me.	Voodoo.yack	313
GUYBRUSH	37307	(angry)Don't play dumb with me, Corina.	Voodoo.yack	314
GUYBRUSH	37308	(angry)I have the map. The Secret of Monkey Island is here!	Voodoo.yack	315
VOODOOLADY	37309	What is it you wish to know?	Voodoo.yack	316
GUYBRUSH	37310	(cross)Can't you read my mind?	Voodoo.yack	318
VOODOOLADY	37311	No need, I can read your face well enough.	Voodoo.yack	319
VOODOOLADY	37312	The Secret is where you suspect it is, inside the large safe near the front door.	Voodoo.yack	320
GUYBRUSH	37313	(cross)Where's The Secret?	Voodoo.yack	321
VOODOOLADY	37314	It is inside the large safe near the front door, of course.	Voodoo.yack	322
GUYBRUSH	37315	(cross)It's in that big safe by the door, right?	Voodoo.yack	323
VOODOOLADY	37316	Yes.	Voodoo.yack	324
GUYBRUSH	37317	(serious)Where are the keys to the safe?	Voodoo.yack	332
GUYBRUSH	37318	I'd like to get it open as soon as possible.	Voodoo.yack	335
VOODOOLADY	37319	I am prevented from helping you with the keys.	Voodoo.yack	336
GUYBRUSH	37320	Gah!	Voodoo.yack	337
VOODOOLADY	37321	But there is one close by who knows much.	Voodoo.yack	338
GUYBRUSH	37322	(impatient)How do I find him?	Voodoo.yack	339
VOODOOLADY	37323	Her.	Voodoo.yack	340
VOODOOLADY	37324	And she will find you.	Voodoo.yack	341
GUYBRUSH	37325	How do you know that?	Voodoo.yack	342
VOODOOLADY	37326	She is outside the shop.	Voodoo.yack	343
GUYBRUSH	37327	(cross)Why did you take The Secret?	Voodoo.yack	345
GUYBRUSH	37328	Doesn't it belong on Monkey Island?	Voodoo.yack	347
VOODOOLADY	37329	I have taken nothing. The safe came to me as you see it, and belongs to someone else.	Voodoo.yack	348
VOODOOLADY	37330	I accepted a fee and cast a spell upon it to prevent it being moved. That is all.	Voodoo.yack	349
GUYBRUSH	37331	Who owns the safe?	Voodoo.yack	351
VOODOOLADY	37332	Alas, there are forces which prevent me from revealing the true owner.	Voodoo.yack	353
GUYBRUSH	37333	(cross)How could you keep this a secret from me?	Voodoo.yack	355
GUYBRUSH	37334	(cross)You knew I was looking for it!	Voodoo.yack	357
VOODOOLADY	37335	It is not a secret “from you,” Guybrush Threepwood.	Voodoo.yack	358
VOODOOLADY	37336	It is a secret, full stop. I am bound by an agreement.	Voodoo.yack	359
GUYBRUSH	37337	(suspicious)Have LeChuck or Captain Madison been here?	Voodoo.yack	361
VOODOOLADY	37338	No.	Voodoo.yack	363
GUYBRUSH	37339	That's weird. They were way ahead of me.	Voodoo.yack	364
VOODOOLADY	37340	Sometimes it's better to have two enemies than one.	Voodoo.yack	365
VOODOOLADY	37341	But you should not waste time.	Voodoo.yack	366
GUYBRUSH	37342	I might have more questions for you later.	Voodoo.yack	368
VOODOOLADY	37343	I might have answers. But I make no promises.	Voodoo.yack	369
GUYBRUSH	37344	(serious)Don't let anyone open that safe while I'm gone. Or steal it.	Voodoo.yack	372
VOODOOLADY	37345	The safe cannot be moved. That is the only assurance I can give.	Voodoo.yack	373
VOODOOLADY	37346	A contract signed in blood, with gruesome punishments for disclosure.	Voodoo.yack	378
GUYBRUSH	37347	Some kind of a voodoo thing?	Voodoo.yack	379
VOODOOLADY	37348	No.	Voodoo.yack	380
GUYBRUSH	32657	The quartermaster will never see me behind this crate.	VoodooShop.dinky	14
GUYBRUSH	32658	That key doesn't go here.	VoodooShop.dinky	42
GUYBRUSH	32659	Ah, the International House of Mojo. This place hasn't changed in years.	VoodooShop.dinky	103
VOODOOLADY	32660	Welcome, Guybrush Threepwood.	VoodooShop.dinky	108
VOODOOLADY	32661	Now, you must go! I have a luncheon.	VoodooShop.dinky	116
GUYBRUSH	32662	At this hour?	VoodooShop.dinky	119
VOODOOLADY	32663	It is a midnight luncheon.	VoodooShop.dinky	121
VOODOOLADY	38796	And YOUR destiny lies at the docks.	VoodooShop.dinky	124
GUYBRUSH	38797	It does?	VoodooShop.dinky	126
VOODOOLADY	38798	Most assuredly.	VoodooShop.dinky	128
GUYBRUSH	32664	I'll take this disgusting shrunken head.	VoodooShop.dinky	150
VOODOOLADY	32665	That's my last one. Quite the bargain.	VoodooShop.dinky	152
GUYBRUSH	32666	I'll take this forgiveness frog.	VoodooShop.dinky	155
VOODOOLADY	32667	It can help someone forgive even very old transgressions.	VoodooShop.dinky	157
GUYBRUSH	32668	I'd like this knife.	VoodooShop.dinky	160
VOODOOLADY	32669	An excellent choice.	VoodooShop.dinky	162
VOODOOLADY	32670	I will need you to verbally agree to a release of liability.	VoodooShop.dinky	164
GUYBRUSH	32671	Okay.	VoodooShop.dinky	166
VOODOOLADY	32672	“This product is not to be used in the commission of any crime, including vandalism, jailbreak, and theft of ancient priceless artifacts.”	VoodooShop.dinky	168
GUYBRUSH	32673	No problem.	VoodooShop.dinky	170
VOODOOLADY	32674	“Threatening, frightening, stabbing, shaving, or manicuring yourself or another person are likewise considered outside the scope of acceptable use.”	VoodooShop.dinky	172
GUYBRUSH	32675	{small_shrug}Oh. Okay, I guess.	VoodooShop.dinky	174
VOODOOLADY	32676	“The product is not balanced for throwing. Throwing the product violates these terms and will invalidate the warranty.”	VoodooShop.dinky	176
VOODOOLADY	32677	“Whittling, scrimshaw, mumbledy-peg, juggling, and any tricks involving stacking or balancing the product may cause serious injury and should not be attempted by unlicensed persons.”	VoodooShop.dinky	178
GUYBRUSH	32678	Uh-huh.	VoodooShop.dinky	180
VOODOOLADY	32679	“Use with breads, spreads, bedspreads, or thread may damage the product. If damaged, the product should not be used.”	VoodooShop.dinky	182
VOODOOLADY	32680	“Product is sharp, and should not be carried in a pocket, coat, belt, hat band, handbag, shoulder holster, or sheath.”	VoodooShop.dinky	184
VOODOOLADY	32681	“At all times, keep the product away from children, pets, the aged or infirm, clowns, pirates, and adults. Where possible it should be locked securely in a vault.”	VoodooShop.dinky	186
VOODOOLADY	32682	“The manufacturer accepts no responsibility for the consequences of any use or misuse of this product. By verbally assenting to these terms, purchaser hereby assumes all liability, past, present, and future, throughout this and all possible and impossible universes.”	VoodooShop.dinky	188
GUYBRUSH	32683	Is this where I say yes?	VoodooShop.dinky	191
VOODOOLADY	32684	Yes.	VoodooShop.dinky	193
GUYBRUSH	32685	Yes.	VoodooShop.dinky	195
GUYBRUSH	32686	Is there anything I AM allowed to do with it?	VoodooShop.dinky	197
VOODOOLADY	32687	I am not able to answer that question, as it could create a liability issue.	VoodooShop.dinky	199
HOVER	11581	Leave the International House of Mojo	VoodooShop.dinky	253
HOVER	11582	Chat with the Voodoo Lady	VoodooShop.dinky	261
HOVER	11583	Settle accounts	VoodooShop.dinky	266
GUYBRUSH	32688	Do I owe you anything at the moment?	VoodooShop.dinky	271
VOODOOLADY	32689	Much.	VoodooShop.dinky	273
GUYBRUSH	32690	You're not talking about money, are you?	VoodooShop.dinky	275
VOODOOLADY	32691	No.	VoodooShop.dinky	277
HOVER	11584	Tell me more!	VoodooShop.dinky	288
HOVER	11585	What is this?	VoodooShop.dinky	288
VOODOOLADY	32692	I can tell you no more. If it's forgiveness you seek, buy the frog.	VoodooShop.dinky	293
GUYBRUSH	32693	What's this thing?	VoodooShop.dinky	295
VOODOOLADY	32694	It's a forgiveness frog.	VoodooShop.dinky	297
VOODOOLADY	32695	When no apology will do, give the forgiveness frog.	VoodooShop.dinky	299
VOODOOLADY	32696	It's like a card, only much better, because it's a frog.	VoodooShop.dinky	301
GUYBRUSH	32697	{confused}I've never heard of that before. Are you sure it's real voodoo?	VoodooShop.dinky	303
VOODOOLADY	32698	No comment. It works, trust me.	VoodooShop.dinky	305
HOVER	11586	I think I'll buy one of these	VoodooShop.dinky	312
HOVER	11587	Ew... a little head	VoodooShop.dinky	320
GUYBRUSH	32699	I didn't know these were a voodoo thing?	VoodooShop.dinky	327
VOODOOLADY	32700	They're not. But the tourists like them.	VoodooShop.dinky	329
HOVER	11588	You can never own enough of these	VoodooShop.dinky	336
HOVER	11589	This looks really sharp	VoodooShop.dinky	346
GUYBRUSH	32701	Pointy!	VoodooShop.dinky	348
VOODOOLADY	32702	It is a non-magical ceremonial knife. Very sharp indeed.	VoodooShop.dinky	350
HOVER	11590	I really want this	VoodooShop.dinky	353
HOVER	11591	No disguises in here	VoodooShop.dinky	364
HOVER	11592	Disguises?	VoodooShop.dinky	364
HOVER	11593	Impressive cauldron	VoodooShop.dinky	376
GUYBRUSH	32703	What's cooking?	VoodooShop.dinky	378
VOODOOLADY	32704	The feast of knowledge.	VoodooShop.dinky	380
HOVER	11594	Impressive chair	VoodooShop.dinky	387
GUYBRUSH	32705	I've always been impressed by your chair.	VoodooShop.dinky	389
VOODOOLADY	32706	Thank you.	VoodooShop.dinky	391
HOVER	11595	Check out the rugged safe	VoodooShop.dinky	399
HOVER	12273	Ask about buying the safe	VoodooShop.dinky	399
GUYBRUSH	32707	It's an unusual safe with five keyholes.	VoodooShop.dinky	403
VOODOOLADY	39592	Alas, the safe is not for sale. It has been placed with me for safekeeping.	VoodooShop.dinky	405
GUYBRUSH	39593	How much for the safe?	VoodooShop.dinky	409
VOODOOLADY	39594	It is not for sale at any price. As I said, it has been placed with me for safekeeping.	VoodooShop.dinky	411
HOVER	11596	Open the rugged safe	VoodooShop.dinky	419
GUYBRUSH	32709	I'd need a lot of keys to open that.	VoodooShop.dinky	422

IRONROSE	35901	Meeting adjourned!	Voting.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	35337	That did seem like a better way to get here than making the potion.	WalkAndTalk.yack	15
GUYBRUSH	39010	I'll definitely have to take notes next time!	WalkAndTalk.yack	16
ELAINE	39678	Yes. I just hope it turns out to be worth all the effort.	WalkAndTalk.yack	18
GUYBRUSH	39679	What effort? That was easy.	WalkAndTalk.yack	19
ELAINE	39680	I'm not talking about the trip over, I mean all the work you've done leading up to it.	WalkAndTalk.yack	20
ELAINE	39681	Not to mention the trail of destruction you've left in your wake.	WalkAndTalk.yack	21
GUYBRUSH	39014	You know what they say about omelets and eggs.	WalkAndTalk.yack	23
ELAINE	39015	I haven't seen the omelet yet. Just a lot of eggs.	WalkAndTalk.yack	25		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	39016	The omelet is The Secret of Monkey Island!	WalkAndTalk.yack	26
GUYBRUSH	39017	And I don't know that I'd say “lots” of eggs. A few eggs.	WalkAndTalk.yack	27
GUYBRUSH	39018	Of course. I'm a pirate.	WalkAndTalk.yack	28
GUYBRUSH	39019	It's part of the lifestyle.	WalkAndTalk.yack	30
ELAINE	39020	It can still be surprising when you encounter it in practice.	WalkAndTalk.yack	31
GUYBRUSH	39021	Nonsense. Give me twelve examples.	WalkAndTalk.yack	32
ELAINE	39022	(very short laugh)Haha!	WalkAndTalk.yack	34
ELAINE	39023	(cheery)If you meant to challenge me, you should have gone for a larger number.	WalkAndTalk.yack	35
ELAINE	35371	Odina told me an exciting story about what happened on Brrr Muda.	WalkAndTalk.yack	40
ELAINE	35372	Apparently you managed to destroy a priceless traditional artifact, and the government of an entire island, in five minutes flat.	WalkAndTalk.yack	41
ELAINE	39024	That's quite impressive, even for you!	WalkAndTalk.yack	42
GUYBRUSH	39025	It took way more than five minutes.	WalkAndTalk.yack	44
GUYBRUSH	39026	I had to win a bunch of contests first.	WalkAndTalk.yack	45
ELAINE	39027	Yes. Odina told me your joke!	WalkAndTalk.yack	46
ELAINE	39028	(amused)“Uncomfortable under the arms!”	WalkAndTalk.yack	47
ELAINE	39029	(amused)“Bernie!”	WalkAndTalk.yack	48
ELAINE	39030	(amused)“Owwww!”	WalkAndTalk.yack	49
ELAINE	39031	Quite funny.	WalkAndTalk.yack	50
GUYBRUSH	39032	The crown was flimsy, it just fell apart.	WalkAndTalk.yack	51
ELAINE	39033	Someone who was there described you as straining so hard she thought you might tear your own arm off.	WalkAndTalk.yack	52
ELAINE	39034	But maybe she was exaggerating.	WalkAndTalk.yack	53
GUYBRUSH	39035	Frankly, I think I did them a favor.	WalkAndTalk.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	39036	That stuff with the contests was nutty.	WalkAndTalk.yack	55
GUYBRUSH	39037	Traditions are great to have but you shouldn't base your government on them.	WalkAndTalk.yack	56
ELAINE	39038	I can't say that I disagree, but it wasn't really your choice to make.	WalkAndTalk.yack	57
GUYBRUSH	39039	Technically, yes it was.	WalkAndTalk.yack	58
GUYBRUSH	39040	As dictated by tradition.	WalkAndTalk.yack	59
ELAINE	35373	Odina also thinks you cheated on your algebra test, and tried to poison her.	WalkAndTalk.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	39041	It wasn't poison. It was just hot pepper.	WalkAndTalk.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	39042	She was fine an hour later.	WalkAndTalk.yack	65
ELAINE	39043	I did have to convince her not to file suit. You owe me one.	WalkAndTalk.yack	66
GUYBRUSH	39044	I appreciate that.	WalkAndTalk.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	39045	It's the Contest of Intelligence. Not the Contest of Algebra.	WalkAndTalk.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	39046	I proved my intelligence by cheating successfully!	WalkAndTalk.yack	69
ELAINE	39047	(confirming)You are very clever.	WalkAndTalk.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	39048	I was solving puzzles!	WalkAndTalk.yack	71
GUYBRUSH	35377	These situations come up and there's only one way to work things out!	WalkAndTalk.yack	72
ELAINE	39049	Is there?	WalkAndTalk.yack	73
GUYBRUSH	39050	Incidentally, I think you might also be royalty now, since you're married to me.	WalkAndTalk.yack	76
ELAINE	39051	I thought something felt different this morning.	WalkAndTalk.yack	77
ELAINE	39052	But I was talking about breaking eggs.	WalkAndTalk.yack	81
ELAINE	39053	But I was talking about your freewheeling “lifestyle.”	WalkAndTalk.yack	82
ELAINE	39054	How many is that now, four?	WalkAndTalk.yack	83
ELAINE	39056	There's been some slight collateral damage to the environment.	WalkAndTalk.yack	88
ELAINE	35383	The mop tree. It was the last one left on Mêlée Island.	WalkAndTalk.yack	89
ELAINE	35384	And I have it on good authority that you had something to do with the earthquake as well.	WalkAndTalk.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	39057	You have to get the mop handle just right.	WalkAndTalk.yack	92
GUYBRUSH	39058	The cook said so. At length.	WalkAndTalk.yack	93
ELAINE	39059	He does go on a bit, doesn't he?	WalkAndTalk.yack	94
ELAINE	39060	He bent my ear for twenty minutes, and I wasn't even trying to make a mop.	WalkAndTalk.yack	95
ELAINE	39061	But still. The whole tree?	WalkAndTalk.yack	96
GUYBRUSH	39062	The earthquake was Captain Lila's fault.	WalkAndTalk.yack	98
GUYBRUSH	39063	Nobody warned me it would happen. In retrospect, that was probably part of their plan.	WalkAndTalk.yack	99
ELAINE	39064	Maybe that one only counts half, then.	WalkAndTalk.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	39065	I also picked some flowers.	WalkAndTalk.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	39066	I also cut off part of a plant in the forest.	WalkAndTalk.yack	103
ELAINE	39067	I doubt you'll make the “most wanted” list for that one.	WalkAndTalk.yack	105
GUYBRUSH	39068	You never know.	WalkAndTalk.yack	106
GUYBRUSH	39069	I can't always predict how these things will turn out.	WalkAndTalk.yack	109
ELAINE	39070	Clearly not.	WalkAndTalk.yack	110
ELAINE	39071	Did you know the Museum of Pirate Lore has shut down?	WalkAndTalk.yack	112
GUYBRUSH	39072	You don't say.	WalkAndTalk.yack	113
ELAINE	35387	Two of its prize exhibits went missing.	WalkAndTalk.yack	114
ELAINE	35388	Its prize exhibit went missing.	WalkAndTalk.yack	115
ELAINE	35389	Curiously, there was only one name in the guestbook.	WalkAndTalk.yack	116
GUYBRUSH	39073	I needed a disguise!	WalkAndTalk.yack	120
GUYBRUSH	39074	It was the only way I could get aboard LeChuck's ship.	WalkAndTalk.yack	121
GUYBRUSH	39075	The guy doesn't like me for some reason. Go figure.	WalkAndTalk.yack	122
GUYBRUSH	39076	It was the only way to find the sunken ship.	WalkAndTalk.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	39077	You'd have loved the ship, Elaine, it was gorgeous!	WalkAndTalk.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	39078	It's sort of fallen apart now. But I didn't do that on purpose. The key was stuck.	WalkAndTalk.yack	125
ELAINE	39079	Haha!	WalkAndTalk.yack	126
ELAINE	39080	(amused)I hadn't heard about that one.	WalkAndTalk.yack	127
GUYBRUSH	39081	It wasn't a very good museum anyway.	WalkAndTalk.yack	129
GUYBRUSH	39082	The guy doesn't get his facts right.	WalkAndTalk.yack	130
ELAINE	39083	Conrad Lee is a nice young man who tries hard.	WalkAndTalk.yack	131
ELAINE	39084	But he'll land on his feet. I hear he's going to open a training school for attack parrots.	WalkAndTalk.yack	132
GUYBRUSH	39085	I hope he doesn't hold a grudge.	WalkAndTalk.yack	133
GUYBRUSH	39086	I used a pseudonym, how did you know it was me?	WalkAndTalk.yack	134
ELAINE	39087	“Mai T. Pirate.” It wasn't hard to figure out.	WalkAndTalk.yack	135
GUYBRUSH	39088	Doesn't everyone use that one?	WalkAndTalk.yack	136
ELAINE	39089	Herman Toothrot is also a little upset with you.	WalkAndTalk.yack	142
ELAINE	39090	He says you took his key and left him in a dark cave.	WalkAndTalk.yack	143
GUYBRUSH	39091	The magic sign only works with one person.	WalkAndTalk.yack	145
GUYBRUSH	39092	And I didn't have any way to know that in advance.	WalkAndTalk.yack	146
GUYBRUSH	39093	I couldn't get back into the cave without the lamp.	WalkAndTalk.yack	147
GUYBRUSH	39094	It, uh, broke.	WalkAndTalk.yack	148
GUYBRUSH	39095	And the old lamp shop on Mêlée shut down years ago.	WalkAndTalk.yack	149
GUYBRUSH	39096	I would have notified the authorities, eventually.	WalkAndTalk.yack	150
GUYBRUSH	39097	But it sounds like that took care of itself already!	WalkAndTalk.yack	151
GUYBRUSH	39098	He was already in the dark cave when I found him.	WalkAndTalk.yack	152
GUYBRUSH	39099	So, to be fair, no net impact overall.	WalkAndTalk.yack	153
ELAINE	39100	Except for the key.	WalkAndTalk.yack	154
GUYBRUSH	39101	True, but he wasn't really using it.	WalkAndTalk.yack	155
ELAINE	39102	Well, you'll be happy to know he made it out. I rescued him myself.	WalkAndTalk.yack	157
GUYBRUSH	39103	I am happy to know that. Thanks.	WalkAndTalk.yack	158
GUYBRUSH	39104	Remind me why we're talking about all this?	WalkAndTalk.yack	161
ELAINE	40687	It's just that I'm worried that The Secret can't possibly measure up to the effort and anticipation.	WalkAndTalk.yack	165
ELAINE	39119	What exactly are you expecting to find?	WalkAndTalk.yack	178
GUYBRUSH	39120	Riches.	WalkAndTalk.yack	180
GUYBRUSH	39121	Life-changing riches.	WalkAndTalk.yack	181
GUYBRUSH	39122	Beyond all reason or comprehension.	WalkAndTalk.yack	182
GUYBRUSH	39123	Glory.	WalkAndTalk.yack	183
GUYBRUSH	39124	I won't just be plain old Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate anymore.	WalkAndTalk.yack	184
ELAINE	39125	No? I've always liked him.	WalkAndTalk.yack	185
GUYBRUSH	39126	But now I'll be Guybrush Threepwood, Secret-finding mighty pirate!	WalkAndTalk.yack	186
GUYBRUSH	39127	Which is way better.	WalkAndTalk.yack	187
GUYBRUSH	39128	Knowledge.	WalkAndTalk.yack	188
GUYBRUSH	39129	The Secret isn't about having something, it's about knowing something.	WalkAndTalk.yack	189
GUYBRUSH	39130	A mystery for the ages! Solved.	WalkAndTalk.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	39131	Understanding.	WalkAndTalk.yack	191
GUYBRUSH	39132	Of The Secret, and of bigger things.	WalkAndTalk.yack	192
GUYBRUSH	39133	Who are we? Why are we here?	WalkAndTalk.yack	193
GUYBRUSH	39134	I have no idea.	WalkAndTalk.yack	194
GUYBRUSH	39135	That's why it's so important that I find it!	WalkAndTalk.yack	195
GUYBRUSH	39136	It doesn't matter.	WalkAndTalk.yack	196
GUYBRUSH	39137	It's just the finding part that counts.	WalkAndTalk.yack	197
ELAINE	39138	Well. Be careful what you wish for.	WalkAndTalk.yack	199
GUYBRUSH	38122	Hey Wally!	Wally.yack	12
GUYBRUSH	40710	(normal voice)Hey Wally!	Wally.yack	15
WALLY	38123	Well, well, well. Look what the surf washed ashore. It's Guybrush Threepwood.	Wally.yack	20
GUYBRUSH	38124	Nice to see you again too... Wally Whatever-your-last-name-is.	Wally.yack	21
WALLY	38125	I spent years in therapy getting over being burned, blinded, blown-up, abandoned and marooned because of you.	Wally.yack	22
GUYBRUSH	38126	{happy}Yeah, good times, eh?	Wally.yack	23
WALLY	38127	You're lucky I'm past all that and am running the best map shop within the Caribbean and beyond.	Wally.yack	24
GUYBRUSH	38128	Nice weather.	Wally.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	38129	Mêlée Clock is still broken.	Wally.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	38130	So... the Lookout is still kicking.	Wally.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	38131	It's the pirate life for me.	Wally.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	38132	Busy?	Wally.yack	29
GUYBRUSH	38133	I'm looking for a mop.	Wally.yack	31
WALLY	38134	This is MAPS-n-More, not MOPS-n-More.	Wally.yack	32
GUYBRUSH	38135	I was hoping the “-n-More” might include mops.	Wally.yack	33
WALLY	38136	Well, it doesn't. Try asking the cook over at the bar where he got his.	Wally.yack	34
GUYBRUSH	38137	Have you got a sea map of the local area?	Wally.yack	36
GUYBRUSH	38138	{confused}You wouldn't happen to have a map to The Secret of Monkey Island?	Wally.yack	37
GUYBRUSH	38139	{point_hold}I'm putting together an expedition... I mean raiding party.	Wally.yack	39
WALLY	38140	Funny you should ask. I recently made one on commission but then they destroyed all my source material.	Wally.yack	40
WALLY	38141	It is the only one in existence. Best of luck to you.	Wally.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	38142	I found this sliver of wood, can you use this to make the map to the mop tree?	Wally.yack	44
WALLY	38143	Looks legit. I'll see what I can do.	Wally.yack	48
TEXT	20483	Ten minutes later...	Wally.yack	53
WALLY	38144	Here it is.	Wally.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	38145	Thanks, Wally.	Wally.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	38146	{fists_on_hips}I'm looking for a tree to make a stupid mop from.	Wally.yack	65
GUYBRUSH	38147	Have you got a map for that?	Wally.yack	66
WALLY	38148	So the cook has sent you on one of his spiritual journeys?	Wally.yack	67
WALLY	38149	Been a while since I made one of those mop tree maps. What kind of tree is it again?	Wally.yack	68
GUYBRUSH	38150	{small_shrug}I don't know. A wood one.	Wally.yack	69
WALLY	38151	That's okay. Just bring me a sliver of the wood and I can work it out from there. I'm that good.	Wally.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	38152	Tell me again what you need to make me a map to the mop tree.	Wally.yack	74
WALLY	38153	Just bring me a sliver of the wood needed to make a mop.	Wally.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	38154	I'm looking for a map through the forest?	Wally.yack	79
WALLY	38155	What are you trying to find in the forest?	Wally.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	38156	I don't know, nothing in particular.	Wally.yack	81
WALLY	38157	Then having a map won't really be any different than wandering around lost, will it?	Wally.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	38158	{shrug}Yeah... but... I mean... well... never mind.	Wally.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	38159	What was the deal with all the crazy maps on Monkey Island?	Wally.yack	85
WALLY	38160	I made the map to The Secret...	Wally.yack	86
WALLY	38161	...and a darn good one I might add...	Wally.yack	87
WALLY	38162	...but what other people do with it after purchase is not my legal responsibility.	Wally.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	38163	{defiant}Why didn't you tell me the map said The Secret was RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET!	Wally.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	38164	{frustration}That would have saved me A LOT OF TIME!	Wally.yack	91
WALLY	38165	Sorry, but I was all NDA'd up on that one.	Wally.yack	92
GUYBRUSH	38166	You have a lot of maps in here.	Wally.yack	94
WALLY	38167	We've got so many you need a map to find them all.	Wally.yack	95
WALLY	38168	A little cartographer humor.	Wally.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	38169	Yeah, I'd forgotten how funny it was.	Wally.yack	98
GUYBRUSH	38170	Looks like the shop across the way is in trouble.	Wally.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	38171	The town seems to be pretty run down.	Wally.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	38172	It's great to see you landed on your feet after all these years.	Wally.yack	102
WALLY	38173	Business has been booming with all these new Dark Magic pirates.	Wally.yack	103
WALLY	38174	Captain Madison has me on a lucrative retainer.	Wally.yack	104
WALLY	38175	She pays extra for a bunch of wacky symbols I just make up.	Wally.yack	105
GUYBRUSH	38176	I'll let you get back to cartogramographing.	Wally.yack	106
WALLY	38177	That's not a real word.	Wally.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	38178	(dismissive)Uh-huh.	Wally.yack	108
WALLY	38179	Yep.	Wally.yack	111
GUYBRUSH	38180	Bye.	Wally.yack	113
WALLY	38181	The high-stakes ego-driven world of pirating is changing and Dark Magic is taking over.	Wally.yack	117
WALLY	38182	Voodoo magic is fun and all but it's not what the new generation wants.	Wally.yack	118
WALLY	38183	Me? I'm on the bleeding edge and making a bundle. I'm about to franchise.	Wally.yack	119
WALLY	38184	Since Captain Madison made Mêlée her base of operations, people have been complaining.	Wally.yack	123
WALLY	38185	They say she brings a bad element to town, but that “bad element” spends a lot of money on maps.	Wally.yack	124
WALLY	38186	So... what am I supposed to do.	Wally.yack	125
GUYBRUSH	38187	Do what's right?	Wally.yack	126
WALLY	38188	I am. I'm doing what's right for Wally.	Wally.yack	127
GUYBRUSH	38189	And can you jot down the locations of Terror Island and Brrr Muda?	Wally.yack	138
WALLY	38190	No problem. I'll also add a few extras.	Wally.yack	139
WALLY	38191	The ship-tracking feature is going to blow your mind. It's a little trick I know.	Wally.yack	140
WALLY	38192	You need to be able to go the extra mile if you want to make it in the big time, like me.	Wally.yack	141
WALLY	39683	Be careful, the last pirates I made a map to Terror Island for were never seen again.	Wally.yack	155
WALLY	39684	And Brrr Muda can chill you to the bone. Not many pirates want to head up there.	Wally.yack	156
WALLY	39685	Oh, and when you get to Scurvy Island, say hi to Elaine for me.	Wally.yack	157
GUYBRUSH	38193	Thanks Wally, and sorry about blowing you up that one time.	Wally.yack	158
GUYBRUSH	38194	How's it hanging?	Wally.yack	163
WALLY	38195	Seriously, that's the joke you're going to use right now?	Wally.yack	164
GUYBRUSH	38196	I'm trying out some new material.	Wally.yack	165
WALLY	40173	(irritated)Mmhmm	Wally.yack	165
WALLY	38197	Don't quit your day job.	Wally.yack	166
GUYBRUSH	38198	Wally, what happened?	Wally.yack	168
WALLY	38199	As if you don't know.	Wally.yack	169
GUYBRUSH	38200	How did you end up here? I saw your office had been ransacked.	Wally.yack	171
WALLY	38201	LeChuck came into the shop storming mad because he thought I gave him a mop map instead of a map to The Secret.	Wally.yack	173
GUYBRUSH	38202	(sheepish)Yeah, real head scratcher how that happened.	Wally.yack	174
GUYBRUSH	38203	Thanks for the sea map.	Wally.yack	176
GUYBRUSH	38204	That was really great and I owe you for all the work you did for free.	Wally.yack	177
WALLY	38205	Glad you liked it.	Wally.yack	178
GUYBRUSH	38206	I coughed up a good chunk of my savings, but I guess it all worked out.	Wally.yack	179
WALLY	38207	It depends on your definition of “all worked out.”	Wally.yack	180
GUYBRUSH	38208	That mop map you made for me was a winner.	Wally.yack	182
WALLY	38209	Glad you liked it.	Wally.yack	183
WALLY	38210	Oh yeah... That's right... I did make you a mop map.	Wally.yack	186
WALLY	38211	Wait... it's all starting to make sense now...	Wally.yack	187
WALLY	38212	Why is it that every time our paths cross good ol' Wally is kidnapped and tormented or worse?	Wally.yack	188
GUYBRUSH	38213	The mysteries of how the universe works may never be known.	Wally.yack	189
GUYBRUSH	38214	I wish I could get you out of those shackles.	Wally.yack	191
WALLY	38215	You and me both.	Wally.yack	192
GUYBRUSH	38216	I'd love to stay and chat but...	Wally.yack	194
GUYBRUSH	38217	I've got to get The Secret before LeChuck does.	Wally.yack	195
WALLY	38218	(sarcastic)Sure, run off. Wally will be fine.	Wally.yack	196
GUYBRUSH	32598	{point_hold}Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!	WallysMaps.dinky	23
WALLY	32599	Oh please, take one! I use them to promote my business, see, it says 'Maps-n-More' on the edge!	WallysMaps.dinky	45
GUYBRUSH	32600	Er, thanks!	WallysMaps.dinky	47
GUYBRUSH	32601	Better to have one for each eye.	WallysMaps.dinky	70
WALLY	32602	If you say so.	WallysMaps.dinky	73
HOVER	11538	Leave Wally's Maps-n-More	WallysMaps.dinky	147
HOVER	11539	Ooh, a monocle	WallysMaps.dinky	178
HOVER	11540	Ooh, a box of monocles	WallysMaps.dinky	178
GUYBRUSH	38792	They're like glasses, only way less convenient.	WallysMaps.dinky	181
HOVER	11541	Sneak a monocle	WallysMaps.dinky	185
HOVER	11542	Take another monocle	WallysMaps.dinky	185
HOVER	11543	Browse the box of maps	WallysMaps.dinky	195
GUYBRUSH	32605	Wally, can I have one of these maps?	WallysMaps.dinky	198
WALLY	32606	Absolutely! If you pay for it.	WallysMaps.dinky	201
GUYBRUSH	32607	Never mind.	WallysMaps.dinky	203
HOVER	11544	An old lamp	WallysMaps.dinky	216
GUYBRUSH	32608	I appreciate that Wally hasn't traded it in for a new model just because it's been around the block once or twice.	WallysMaps.dinky	218
GUYBRUSH	32609	I feel very strongly about that for some reason.	WallysMaps.dinky	220
HOVER	11545	Admire the fan map	WallysMaps.dinky	226
GUYBRUSH	32610	It's a map on a fan. What'll they think of next?	WallysMaps.dinky	229
HOVER	11546	That's one fancy map	WallysMaps.dinky	236
GUYBRUSH	32611	This map shows both sides of the globe.	WallysMaps.dinky	239
WALLY	32612	It's twice the value.	WallysMaps.dinky	242
HOVER	11547	A map covered in pins and threads	WallysMaps.dinky	251
GUYBRUSH	32613	What's this a map of?	WallysMaps.dinky	254
WALLY	32614	The secret movements and activities of my competitors.	WallysMaps.dinky	257
GUYBRUSH	32615	That sounds reasonable.	WallysMaps.dinky	259
HOVER	11548	Look at the polar map	WallysMaps.dinky	268
GUYBRUSH	32616	Looks chilly up there.	WallysMaps.dinky	271
HOVER	11549	That island looks like a pair of trousers	WallysMaps.dinky	277
GUYBRUSH	32617	This must be Trouser Island.	WallysMaps.dinky	280
WALLY	32618	Actually, Mr. Threepwood, it's--	WallysMaps.dinky	283
GUYBRUSH	32619	Yep, Trouser Island.	WallysMaps.dinky	285
HOVER	11550	This map is taller than I am	WallysMaps.dinky	294
GUYBRUSH	32620	I had a map like this once, but I sailed left.	WallysMaps.dinky	297
HOVER	11551	Ask about the boxes	WallysMaps.dinky	303
GUYBRUSH	32621	Hey Wally, what's in these boxes?	WallysMaps.dinky	306
WALLY	32622	Maps!	WallysMaps.dinky	309
HOVER	11552	What a handsome map	WallysMaps.dinky	318
GUYBRUSH	32623	This one looks nice. How much is it?	WallysMaps.dinky	321
WALLY	32624	Oh, that one? Too much.	WallysMaps.dinky	324
HOVER	11553	A solid gold compass rose?	WallysMaps.dinky	334
GUYBRUSH	32625	It looks expensive. And shiny.	WallysMaps.dinky	336
GUYBRUSH	32626	I like shiny.	WallysMaps.dinky	338
HOVER	11554	Look at the spikey map	WallysMaps.dinky	344
GUYBRUSH	32627	That looks like a treacherous voyage.	WallysMaps.dinky	347
GUYBRUSH	32628	It says “Rating: Cursed Black Diamond.”	WallysMaps.dinky	347
HOVER	11555	A low-cost, pre-owned map	WallysMaps.dinky	353
GUYBRUSH	32629	The first rule of piracy is, “Never buy a used treasure map.”	WallysMaps.dinky	356
HOVER	11556	A slightly suspicious ladder to a window	WallysMaps.dinky	362
GUYBRUSH	32630	Hey Wally, what's with the window ladder?	WallysMaps.dinky	364
WALLY	32631	I use it to keep an eye on the neighbors.	WallysMaps.dinky	367
GUYBRUSH	32632	Well, it's good to have a hobby.	WallysMaps.dinky	369
HOVER	11557	Look at the maze map	WallysMaps.dinky	379
GUYBRUSH	32633	Good old mazes. Can't get enough mazes.	WallysMaps.dinky	382
HOVER	11558	Look at the patterned map	WallysMaps.dinky	389
GUYBRUSH	32634	Huh. Never seen one of those before.	WallysMaps.dinky	392
HOVER	11559	It's a map full of monsters	WallysMaps.dinky	398
GUYBRUSH	32635	I try to steer clear of sea monsters, myself.	WallysMaps.dinky	401
HOVER	11560	Check out the small map	WallysMaps.dinky	408
GUYBRUSH	32636	Somewhat understated, and somewhat overpriced.	WallysMaps.dinky	411
HOVER	11561	A globe, in a map store?	WallysMaps.dinky	419
GUYBRUSH	32637	I didn't know you made globes, too.	WallysMaps.dinky	422
WALLY	32638	I don't. This is for reference. It's got all the latest continents.	WallysMaps.dinky	425
HOVER	11562	It's Wally's cartography stuff	WallysMaps.dinky	436
GUYBRUSH	32639	Oo! Those look fancy.	WallysMaps.dinky	438
WALLY	32640	The finest tools, to make the finest maps.	WallysMaps.dinky	441
HOVER	11563	An odd map, up in the corner	WallysMaps.dinky	450
GUYBRUSH	32641	It's a long, small map of somewhere far, far away.	WallysMaps.dinky	453
HOVER	11564	Check out the innovative map bundle	WallysMaps.dinky	459
GUYBRUSH	32642	It's maps wrapped in maps. I didn't know you could do that.	WallysMaps.dinky	462
HOVER	11565	Talk to Wally	WallysMaps.dinky	475
HOVER	11566	Settle accounts	WallysMaps.dinky	480
GUYBRUSH	32643	Do I owe you anything at the moment?	WallysMaps.dinky	485
WALLY	32644	Ha! Yes. I'm doing so well right now that sometimes I forget to collect payment on small orders like yours!	WallysMaps.dinky	490
GUYBRUSH	32645	This should cover it.	WallysMaps.dinky	495
WALLY	32646	Thanks.	WallysMaps.dinky	497
WALLY	32647	I don't think so.	WallysMaps.dinky	500
GUYBRUSH	38773	Wally? What happened here? Wally's shop has been ransacked.	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	28
HOVER	11360	Leave Wally's Maps-n-More	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	40
HOVER	11361	Where's Wally?	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	54
GUYBRUSH	32377	Wally? Can you hear me? Are you ok?	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	57
GUYBRUSH	32378	I guess he's not here, and he's probably not ok.	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	60
HOVER	11362	Look at the destroyed sea monster map	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	67
GUYBRUSH	32379	These maps were Wally's life's work.	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	69
GUYBRUSH	32380	At least I assume so.	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	71
HOVER	11363	It's a pile of wreckage	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	77
GUYBRUSH	32381	This is all that's left of Wally's standard sized maps, globe, odd sized maps, and boxes of other maps.	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	79
HOVER	11364	The compass rose is still here	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	86
GUYBRUSH	32382	They left behind the solid gold compass rose. This was no standard plundering.	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	88
HOVER	11365	Someone had it in for these maps	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	94
GUYBRUSH	32383	Who could have done this?	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	97
GUYBRUSH	32384	I guess LeChuck, obviously.	WallysMapsDestroyed.dinky	100
GULLET	37872	The name's Gullet, but you're not to call me that. To you I'm the First Swab, and I want to hear the capital letters when you say it.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	17
GUYBRUSH	37873	Capital 1. Got it.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	18
GULLET	37874	This is the hold. You'll be spending a lot of time down here.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	19
GUYBRUSH	37875	I thought we'd have a union or something. How much time is a lot of time?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	20
GULLET	37876	ALL OF IT!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	21
GULLET	37877	You work here! You sleep here! You take your meals here!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	22
GULLET	37878	Forget the world you knew before! This hold is your world!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	23
GULLET	37879	The hull is your ground! The deck is your sky!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	24
GULLET	37880	And I am your deity of choice! A cruel and vengeful deity!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	25
GULLET	37881	I only have one simple rule:	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	26		UPDATE
GULLET	37882	You are not to leave this hold under any circumstances!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	27
GULLET	37883	Any questions?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	37884	Can I leave the hold?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	34
GULLET	37885	Wh-- No!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	37886	What happens if I leave?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	37
GULLET	37887	I said you are not to leave under any circumstances!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	38
GUYBRUSH	37888	{small_shrug}I know, just, hypothetically what if I did?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	39
GULLET	37889	The worst punishment you can imagine!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	40
GUYBRUSH	37890	{shrug}Which is...?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	41
GULLET	37891	I throw you back down here! Nothing's worse than this!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	42
GULLET	37892	HAHAHAHAHA!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	43
GUYBRUSH	37893	Where's my bunk?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	45
GULLET	37894	You might be all right inside one of the crates.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	46
GULLET	37895	Otherwise be sure to cover your eyes, the chickens like to peck!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	47
GULLET	37896	But it's probably safest if you don't sleep at all. The chickens have their ways.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	48		UPDATE
GUYBRUSH	37897	What's for dinner?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	50
GULLET	37898	Oh, we'd like a bit of “dinner,” would we?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	51
GULLET	37899	Well, perhaps we can arrange a bit of roast duck under glass for your majesty.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	52
GULLET	37900	HAHAHAHAHA!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	53
GULLET	37901	But seriously...	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	54
GULLET	37902	Learn to catch rats.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	55
GULLET	37903	You can drown 'em in your mop bucket. They make their own sauce.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	56
GUYBRUSH	37904	What if I need to, um... you know.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	58
GULLET	37905	Use the porthole!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	59
GULLET	37906	Don't get anything on the ledge outside though. I hate an unsightly ledge!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	60
GUYBRUSH	37907	What am I supposed to be doing, exactly?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	62
GULLET	37908	New recruits! You're all thicker than the chickens!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	37909	Er... is that the whole answer?	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	81
GULLET	37910	You're supposed to be swabbing!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	93
GULLET	37911	I want this hold sparkling. As if it was clean!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	95
GULLET	37912	Now, get to work!	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	97
GUYBRUSH	37913	(dejected)Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me.	WelcomeToLeShip.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	37821	(talking up to window)Hi.	WideyBones.yack	34
WIDEYBONES	37822	Bright boy! How is your search?	WideyBones.yack	38
WIDEYBONES	37823	Hey, boy.	WideyBones.yack	39
GUYBRUSH	37824	Are you okay?	WideyBones.yack	42
WIDEYBONES	37825	Only my spirit is crushed. Rest of me will heal.	WideyBones.yack	43
GUYBRUSH	37826	I think I may have found your key!	WideyBones.yack	45
WIDEYBONES	37827	That's good! You be the caretaker now, I don't need the danger.	WideyBones.yack	47
GUYBRUSH	37828	I've got a Golden Key!	WideyBones.yack	49
WIDEYBONES	37829	Then we're equal now! You come back when you got more than me, maybe we can talk about something.	WideyBones.yack	51
GUYBRUSH	37830	I've got two Golden Keys!	WideyBones.yack	53
GUYBRUSH	37831	I've got three Golden Keys!	WideyBones.yack	54
GUYBRUSH	37832	I've got four Golden Keys!	WideyBones.yack	55
GUYBRUSH	37833	I've got all five Golden Keys!	WideyBones.yack	56
WIDEYBONES	37834	Then what are you doing here, bright boy? Go claim your prize!	WideyBones.yack	57
GUYBRUSH	37835	Can I borrow your Golden Key?	WideyBones.yack	59
GUYBRUSH	37836	Remind me again what you know about where the Golden Keys might be.	WideyBones.yack	60
WIDEYBONES	37837	Well I've got one.	WideyBones.yack	61
WIDEYBONES	37838	Well the mean little ghost lady got mine.	WideyBones.yack	62
WIDEYBONES	37839	Old Mrs. Smith had one, I guess she'll have willed it to someone in her estate.	WideyBones.yack	63
WIDEYBONES	37840	There's the one Bella Fisher had, must be at the bottom of the ocean now.	WideyBones.yack	64
WIDEYBONES	37841	One somewhere on Brrr Muda, and one on Terror Island.	WideyBones.yack	65
WIDEYBONES	37842	That'll be all I know.	WideyBones.yack	66
WIDEYBONES	37843	Not much chance to collect them all, so it seems.	WideyBones.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	37844	(talking up to window)You spend a lot of time looking out your window!	WideyBones.yack	69
WIDEYBONES	37845	(talking down from window)I watch the locksmith. Maybe somebody comes with a Golden Key someday, you know?	WideyBones.yack	70
GUYBRUSH	37846	(talking up to window)Anything is possible.	WideyBones.yack	71
WIDEYBONES	37847	(talking down from window)I keep an eye on the fish shop too, there is a mystery here. Lot of fish but no boat.	WideyBones.yack	72
GUYBRUSH	37848	(talking up to window)Did you mean what you said about a curse?	WideyBones.yack	74
WIDEYBONES	37849	(talking down from window)You still gonna look for the keys if it's true?	WideyBones.yack	75
GUYBRUSH	37850	(talking up to window)Of course.	WideyBones.yack	76
WIDEYBONES	37851	(talking down from window)Then it does not matter.	WideyBones.yack	77
GUYBRUSH	37852	Are you sure I can't borrow your Golden Key?	WideyBones.yack	79
GUYBRUSH	37853	I'm sorry to hear about your key.	WideyBones.yack	80
WIDEYBONES	37854	I hope your luck is better.	WideyBones.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	39389	Remind me who took your key?	WideyBones.yack	83
WIDEYBONES	39390	Some stocky little ghost pirate lady. I didn't recognize her.	WideyBones.yack	84
GUYBRUSH	37855	(talking up to window)See you around, Widey.	WideyBones.yack	86
WIDEYBONES	37856	(talking down from window)Most likely.	WideyBones.yack	87
WIDEYBONES	37857	How many keys you got yourself, boy?	WideyBones.yack	94
GUYBRUSH	37858	Uh... none.	WideyBones.yack	95
GUYBRUSH	37859	One. Same as you.	WideyBones.yack	96
WIDEYBONES	37860	Come back when you've got more than I got. Maybe we can talk partnership then.	WideyBones.yack	97
WIDEYBONES	37861	Hey, boy. Got a warning for you.	WideyBones.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	37862	A warning?	WideyBones.yack	105
WIDEYBONES	37863	You're in danger. A stocky little ghost lady found me out, she came here and roughed me up.	WideyBones.yack	106
WIDEYBONES	37864	Took away my Golden Key.	WideyBones.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	37865	Oh no!	WideyBones.yack	108
GUYBRUSH	37866	Uh... any idea where she might have taken it?	WideyBones.yack	109
WIDEYBONES	37867	Don't know. Can't afford to care.	WideyBones.yack	110
WIDEYBONES	37868	I know when I'm beat. I'm giving up on The Secret.	WideyBones.yack	111
WIDEYBONES	37869	You ought to get out, too.	WideyBones.yack	112
GUYBRUSH	37870	Thanks for the warning.	WideyBones.yack	113
WIDEYBONES	37871	Good for you! But you be careful!	WideyBones.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	35151	Aaaa!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	15
WIDEYBONES	35152	You found The Secret! You are a spark among fallen leaves!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	19
GUYBRUSH	35153	I'm pretty excited!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	21
WIDEYBONES	35154	Hold on to that feeling!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	22
GUYBRUSH	35155	Secret? What Secret? I admit nothing.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	23
WIDEYBONES	35156	You can't hide that look in your eye. I know it well.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	24
GUYBRUSH	35157	Does it count as finding it if it's sealed up in a safe?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	25
WIDEYBONES	35158	Finding and seeing are two separate things. It's a step on the road!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	26
GUYBRUSH	35159	Did everybody already know about this but me?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	27
WIDEYBONES	35160	Not at all. Precious few have the smarts and the patience to decipher the clues and find The Secret.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	28
GUYBRUSH	35161	Are you the one who knows about the keys?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	29
WIDEYBONES	35162	More than most!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	30
GUYBRUSH	35163	Aren't you the lady in the window?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	31
WIDEYBONES	35164	I am Widelene Bones. Widey. Like you, the hunt for The Secret consumes me.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	34
WIDEYBONES	35165	Like you, I know where The Secret lies, but lack the means to open the safe.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	35
WIDEYBONES	35166	You must have many questions.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	36
GUYBRUSH	35167	How do I open the safe?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	38
GUYBRUSH	35168	How do I open the safe??	WideyBonesKeys.yack	39
GUYBRUSH	35169	How do I open the safe?!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	40
GUYBRUSH	35170	How do I open the safe!?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	41
GUYBRUSH	35171	How do I open the safe!?!?!?!?!?!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	42
WIDEYBONES	35172	Five locks, five keys. Golden Keys! Hidden long ago.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	44
WIDEYBONES	35173	Most are found already.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	50
WIDEYBONES	35174	Got one myself. Old Mrs. Smith had one before she died, and Bella Fisher, too.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	51
GUYBRUSH	35175	Bella Fisher! I know that name!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	61
WIDEYBONES	35176	Also I heard one was found on Brrr Muda.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	62
GUYBRUSH	35177	That's only four...	WideyBonesKeys.yack	63
WIDEYBONES	35178	One more was supposed to be hidden on Terror Island. That one has never been found.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	64
GUYBRUSH	39008	Hang on, I'm writing all this down on my todo list.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	35179	(marked for wording)This doesn't sound so hard.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	69
WIDEYBONES	35180	Lot of people don't come back from Terror Island.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	70
WIDEYBONES	35181	Also, Bella Fisher sank out at sea and nobody knows where, took her key with her.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	71
GUYBRUSH	35182	Oh.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	72
WIDEYBONES	35183	Others stopped trying so hard after that. Not many still seeking the Golden Keys.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	73
WIDEYBONES	35184	Maybe just me. And now you.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	74
GUYBRUSH	35185	What do the Golden Keys look like?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	78
WIDEYBONES	35186	They're gold!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	79
WIDEYBONES	35187	It's just paint, but they look nice.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	80
GUYBRUSH	35188	Where can I find the Golden Keys?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	82
GUYBRUSH	35189	Can I borrow the key you have?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	83
GUYBRUSH	35190	Just to try it out?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	85
WIDEYBONES	35191	Not so fast, bright boy.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	86
WIDEYBONES	35192	Widey Bones is not such an easy mark.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	87
WIDEYBONES	35193	You prove yourself, get some skin in the game. Find me when you've got more keys than I do and maybe I talk partnership.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	88
GUYBRUSH	35194	Why is The Secret in the safe instead of on Monkey Island?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	90
GUYBRUSH	35195	Do you know?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	91
WIDEYBONES	35196	Secret's always been in the safe.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	92
GUYBRUSH	35197	Uh-huh.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	93
GUYBRUSH	35198	Could you repeat what you said about who has all the keys?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	95
WIDEYBONES	35199	Old Mrs. Smith had one, she lived here on Mêlée before she died.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	96
WIDEYBONES	35200	And Bella Fisher had one before she went down with her ship on the high seas.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	97
WIDEYBONES	35201	Someone in Brrr Muda must have one, and I've got one.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	98		UPDATE
WIDEYBONES	35202	And the last one's probably still on Terror Island.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	99
GUYBRUSH	35203	Thanks.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	35204	How come I never heard about any of this before?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	35205	I'm kind of a Secret of Monkey Island buff, you'd think I'd know about it.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	103
WIDEYBONES	35206	The clues were buried deep and clever. Only a few ever puzzled them out, and we keep ourselves to ourselves.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	35207	This all seems needlessly complicated.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	106
WIDEYBONES	35208	Life is like that sometimes. Best just enjoy the ride.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	107
GUYBRUSH	35209	You seem more lucid than when you were hanging out of the window on High Street.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	109
WIDEYBONES	35210	We all got our good days and our bad ones.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	110
WIDEYBONES	35211	If you don't know already then you'll see.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	111
GUYBRUSH	35212	See you around, Widey. I've got keys to track down.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	113
WIDEYBONES	35213	Okay, bright boy, but you watch your step.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	115
WIDEYBONES	35214	There is a curse.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	116
WIDEYBONES	35215	The keys are protected by a terrible curse!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	117
WIDEYBONES	35216	Bewaaaaare!	WideyBonesKeys.yack	121
BOYBRUSH	35217	Whoa! A curse? Really?	WideyBonesKeys.yack	128
GUYBRUSH	35218	No.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	130
GUYBRUSH	35219	I mean yes, she did say that, but she was just being dramatic.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	132
GUYBRUSH	35220	Widey likes to make a big exit.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	134
GUYBRUSH	35221	Well one thing's for sure...	WideyBonesKeys.yack	138
GUYBRUSH	35222	...I don't know how to get to either of those islands she mentioned.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	140
GUYBRUSH	35223	I'd better get a good sea map right away.	WideyBonesKeys.yack	142
YARDARM	35563	Nah.	Yardarm.yack	11
YARDARM	35564	Not really.	Yardarm.yack	12
YARDARM	35565	Not so much.	Yardarm.yack	13
YARDARM	35566	Nope.	Yardarm.yack	14
YARDARM	35567	Well, no.	Yardarm.yack	15
GUYBRUSH	35568	Nice looking skull you've got there, Apple Bob.	Yardarm.yack	31
YARDARM	35569	Before you get any ideas: I'm a ghost, my skull won't work, and Putra already asked.	Yardarm.yack	33
YARDARM	35570	Why don't you stick your own head in the pot and see what happens?	Yardarm.yack	34
GUYBRUSH	35571	Relax, I was just making conversation.	Yardarm.yack	35
GUYBRUSH	35572	I'll find a skull someplace else.	Yardarm.yack	36
GUYBRUSH	35573	Sorry if I offended you.	Yardarm.yack	40
YARDARM	35574	Oh, that's okay. I know you're under pressure.	Yardarm.yack	42
GUYBRUSH	35575	Hey Bob, have you got any ideas on how to get to Monkey Island that don't involve a voodoo potion?	Yardarm.yack	46
YARDARM	35576	{expansive_arms}My mind's a blank.	Yardarm.yack	48
YARDARM	35577	I try to keep it that way if possible.	Yardarm.yack	49
GUYBRUSH	35578	I've got an idea for how we can get to Monkey Island after all!	Yardarm.yack	53
YARDARM	35579	Sounds exciting!	Yardarm.yack	55
YARDARM	35580	Rose is right over there, you should get her opinion on it.	Yardarm.yack	56
GUYBRUSH	35581	Bob, I confess I'm a little confused about what your job is.	Yardarm.yack	67
GUYBRUSH	35582	I mean I know you hang up there all day, I'm just not sure why.	Yardarm.yack	68
YARDARM	35583	As yardarm hanger, I serve as an example to the crew of what might happen if they break the rules.	Yardarm.yack	70
YARDARM	35584	It's an important role, though admittedly not an exciting one.	Yardarm.yack	71
GUYBRUSH	35585	What do you like to do for fun?	Yardarm.yack	80
YARDARM	35586	{expansive_arms}Oh, pretty much anything. I'm easy.	Yardarm.yack	81
GUYBRUSH	35587	Sea shanties?	Yardarm.yack	86
GUYBRUSH	35588	Clog dancing?	Yardarm.yack	87
GUYBRUSH	35589	Bowling?	Yardarm.yack	88

GUYBRUSH	35599	Carpentry?	Yardarm.yack	98
GUYBRUSH	35600	Whittling?	Yardarm.yack	99
GUYBRUSH	35601	Whistling?	Yardarm.yack	100
GUYBRUSH	35602	Philosophical discussion?	Yardarm.yack	101
GUYBRUSH	35603	Water ballet?	Yardarm.yack	102
GUYBRUSH	35604	Gin rummy?	Yardarm.yack	103
GUYBRUSH	35605	Checkers?	Yardarm.yack	104
GUYBRUSH	35606	Historical novels?	Yardarm.yack	105

GUYBRUSH	35615	Reading?	Yardarm.yack	114
GUYBRUSH	35616	Could you just pick something?	Yardarm.yack	116
YARDARM	35617	Oh, anything's fine.	Yardarm.yack	118
GUYBRUSH	35618	I'll see what I can find.	Yardarm.yack	120
YARDARM	35619	I do enjoy reading...	Yardarm.yack	123
GUYBRUSH	35620	Aha!	Yardarm.yack	124
GUYBRUSH	35621	I'd like to discuss your vote on the Monkey Island issue.	Yardarm.yack	138
YARDARM	35622	It's “nay.” I'm afraid going to Monkey Island doesn't really have anything in it for me.	Yardarm.yack	139
GUYBRUSH	35623	Wouldn't the change of scenery be nice?	Yardarm.yack	140
YARDARM	35624	I've seen lots of scenery.	Yardarm.yack	141
GUYBRUSH	35625	How about I make it worth your while?	Yardarm.yack	142
YARDARM	35626	Go on...	Yardarm.yack	143
GUYBRUSH	35627	I'll get you transferred to the other yardarm.	Yardarm.yack	146
YARDARM	35628	I've been there. I prefer this one.	Yardarm.yack	147
GUYBRUSH	35629	I'll take your next shift.	Yardarm.yack	149
YARDARM	35630	If I didn't know better I'd say you were after my job. No thanks.	Yardarm.yack	150
GUYBRUSH	35631	I'll be your best friend.	Yardarm.yack	152
YARDARM	35632	My best friend will always be the sea.	Yardarm.yack	153
YARDARM	35633	Or maybe Putra.	Yardarm.yack	154
GUYBRUSH	35634	What would you be interested in?	Yardarm.yack	156
YARDARM	35635	I've got all I need, but... I'm bored.	Yardarm.yack	157
YARDARM	35636	We used to have an entertainment budget but this fancy new ship is leveraged like crazy so there are no frills anymore.	Yardarm.yack	158
GUYBRUSH	35637	Entertainment, you say? I'm sure I can come up with something. Entertainment is my middle name!	Yardarm.yack	159
YARDARM	35638	Ha ha! That's funny. I do like a good joke.	Yardarm.yack	160
YARDARM	35639	They don't last very long, though.	Yardarm.yack	161
GUYBRUSH	35640	How's the book, Bob?	Yardarm.yack	166
YARDARM	35641	Oh, it's very funny! I don't think I've ever heard any of the jokes before.	Yardarm.yack	167
GUYBRUSH	35642	Good, so, you're still on my side about the Monkey Island vote, right?	Yardarm.yack	168
YARDARM	35643	Sure, sure.	Yardarm.yack	169
GUYBRUSH	35644	Hey, Bob.	Yardarm.yack	174
YARDARM	35645	Hey, Gullet.	Yardarm.yack	176
YARDARM	35646	You smell cleaner than usual.	Yardarm.yack	178
GUYBRUSH	35647	Thanks.	Yardarm.yack	179
GUYBRUSH	35648	Do you happen to know LeChuck's catchphrase?	Yardarm.yack	183
GUYBRUSH	35649	I'm trying to be more like him.	Yardarm.yack	184
YARDARM	35650	Well, then you should change your catchphrase every few minutes.	Yardarm.yack	185
YARDARM	35651	I have no idea how he keeps track.	Yardarm.yack	186
GUYBRUSH	35652	Do you happen to know LeChuck's favorite food?	Yardarm.yack	188
YARDARM	35653	No. But Putra probably does. Seeing as how she's the cook and all.	Yardarm.yack	189
GUYBRUSH	35654	Right!	Yardarm.yack	190
GUYBRUSH	35655	Does LeChuck have a theme song?	Yardarm.yack	192
GUYBRUSH	35656	I'm planning a surprise.	Yardarm.yack	193
YARDARM	35657	Surprising LeChuck doesn't sound like a good idea.	Yardarm.yack	194
YARDARM	35658	But he did say something recently about having a theme composed.	Yardarm.yack	195
YARDARM	35659	I don't know if it was ever finished.	Yardarm.yack	196
GUYBRUSH	35660	Remind me what you said about LeChuck's catchphrase?	Yardarm.yack	198
YARDARM	35661	I said it changes often.	Yardarm.yack	199
GUYBRUSH	35662	Oh yeah.	Yardarm.yack	200
GUYBRUSH	35663	What was it you said about LeChuck's favorite food?	Yardarm.yack	202
YARDARM	35664	I said to ask Putra.	Yardarm.yack	203
GUYBRUSH	35665	Oh yeah.	Yardarm.yack	204
GUYBRUSH	35666	I'd still like to hear LeChuck's theme song.	Yardarm.yack	206
YARDARM	35667	Like I said, I think he was having one composed but I don't know anything else about it.	Yardarm.yack	207
GUYBRUSH	35668	Oh yeah.	Yardarm.yack	208
GUYBRUSH	35669	See you.	Yardarm.yack	210
GUYBRUSH	35670	So, um, obviously I'm actually Guybrush Threepwood...	Yardarm.yack	222
YARDARM	35671	Pleased to meet you. Again. I assume that's your real skin this time?	Yardarm.yack	224
GUYBRUSH	35672	Yeah. Sorry for tricking you with the other two.	Yardarm.yack	225
YARDARM	35673	Two?	Yardarm.yack	226
GUYBRUSH	35674	One. Math's not my best subject.	Yardarm.yack	227
YARDARM	35675	Either way, don't worry about it. You're LeChuck's rival, not mine. I've got better things to worry about.	Yardarm.yack	228
YARDARM	35676	Also I enjoyed the book you brought me.	Yardarm.yack	229
GUYBRUSH	35677	Are you finished with the joke book yet?	Yardarm.yack	232
YARDARM	35678	Emotionally, yes. It's not that long and I've read it sixteen times already.	Yardarm.yack	235
GUYBRUSH	35679	Can I have the joke book back?	Yardarm.yack	237
YARDARM	35680	Then what am I supposed to read?	Yardarm.yack	239
GUYBRUSH	35681	You said you were finished! You've read it sixteen times!	Yardarm.yack	240
YARDARM	35682	It's boring reading it over and over, but it's better than nothing.	Yardarm.yack	241
GUYBRUSH	35683	Are you sure I can't have the joke book back?	Yardarm.yack	243
YARDARM	35684	It's boring reading it over and over, but it's better than nothing.	Yardarm.yack	245
GUYBRUSH	35685	Where is everybody?	Yardarm.yack	247
YARDARM	35686	Flambe's up in the crow's nest. Odds are he's sleeping.	Yardarm.yack	250
YARDARM	35687	Iron Rose said she was running an errand.	Yardarm.yack	251
YARDARM	35688	The rest went with LeChuck on that other ship.	Yardarm.yack	252
GUYBRUSH	35689	Would that be Captain Madison's ship?	Yardarm.yack	253
YARDARM	35690	I think that's right.	Yardarm.yack	254
GUYBRUSH	35691	Interesting.	Yardarm.yack	255
GUYBRUSH	35692	Has Iron Rose been back to the ship?	Yardarm.yack	257
YARDARM	35693	She did come back for a bit, yeah.	Yardarm.yack	259
YARDARM	35694	She was in a hurry. Went belowdecks, then came right back up and left again.	Yardarm.yack	260
GUYBRUSH	35695	Very interesting.	Yardarm.yack	261
GUYBRUSH	35696	Don't tell LeChuck I was here, okay?	Yardarm.yack	263
YARDARM	35697	Don't worry, I wouldn't want to risk making him that angry.	Yardarm.yack	265
YARDARM	35698	He gets a bit scary.	Yardarm.yack	266
GUYBRUSH	35699	Remind me why Flambe still has a job? He doesn't do anything.	Yardarm.yack	268
YARDARM	35700	He's handy to have around when we have to fix things below the waterline at night.	Yardarm.yack	269
GUYBRUSH	35701	Finished the new book yet?	Yardarm.yack	271
YARDARM	35702	No! As far as I can tell it has no end!	Yardarm.yack	273
GUYBRUSH	35703	Some stories are better off that way.	Yardarm.yack	274
YARDARM	35704	It's fantastic!	Yardarm.yack	275
GUYBRUSH	35705	Hang in there, Bob.	Yardarm.yack	277
YARDARM	35706	Still not funny.	Yardarm.yack	279
GUYBRUSH	35707	Hang in there, Bob.	Yardarm.yack	282
YARDARM	35708	Still not funny.	Yardarm.yack	284
